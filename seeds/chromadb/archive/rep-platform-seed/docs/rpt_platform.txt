Preamble 
Affirming our belief in God, we still hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men are created equal, 
that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, 
Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness. Throughout the world, people dare to dream of freedom and 
opportunity. The Republican Party of Texas unequivocally defends that dream. We strive to preserve 
the freedom given to us by God, implemented by our Founding Fathers, and embodied in the 
Constitution. We recognize that human nature is immutable. We further recognize that the traditional 
family is the strength of our nation. It is our solemn duty to protect innocent life and develop 
responsible citizens. We understand that our economic success depends upon free market principles. If 
we fail to maintain our sovereignty, we risk losing the freedom to live these ideals.  
Principles 
We, the 2024 Republican Party of Texas, believe in this platform and expect our elected leaders to 
uphold these truths through acknowledgment and action. We believe in: 
1. 
“The laws of nature and nature’s God,” and we support the strict adherence to the original 
language and intent of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitutions of the United States 
and of Texas. 
2. 
The sanctity of innocent human life, created in the image of God, which should be equally 
protected from fertilization to natural death. 
3. 
Preserving individual, Texan, and American sovereignty and freedom.  
4. 
Limiting government power to those items enumerated in the United States and Texas 
Constitutions. 
5. 
Personal accountability and responsibility. 
6. 
Self-sufficient families, founded on the traditional marriage of a natural man and a natural 
woman. 
7. 
Having an educated population, with parents having the freedom of choice for the education of 
their children. 
8. 
The inalienable right of all people to defend themselves and their property. 
9. 
A free enterprise society unencumbered by government interference or subsidies. 
10. Honoring all of those that serve and protect our freedom. 
Constitutional Issues 
Preservation of Constitution 
1. 
Keep Oath to the Constitutions: We call for all who swear the oath to support and maintain the 
limitations and clear meaning of the United States and Texas Constitutions. 
2. 
Amendments to the Texas Constitution: For the preservation of our Constitutional Republic as set 
forth in the Texas Bill of Rights we: 
a) Support an amendment to the Texas Constitution that will require a majority of the voters in at 
least 170 counties (two-thirds), instead of a simple majority of the votes, to pass amendments. 
b) Support limiting the terms of the Texas Speaker of the House to two consecutive terms, after 
which the Speaker must vacate the office for the same number of terms served, after which 
that Speaker is eligible to run again.

4
c) Support an amendment to Article 4, Section 8, of the Texas Constitution to allow the Texas 
Legislature to convene itself upon petition from 55 percent of each house’s elected and serving 
members between Regular Sessions. 
d) Support an amendment for term limits of twelve (12) years for state and county offices. 
e) Support an amendment to allow the Attorney General of Texas to prosecute cases anywhere in 
Texas where county district attorneys refuse to enforce state law, and to prosecute those who 
are accused with prima facie evidence of violating state laws. 
f) Support amending the language of the Texas Constitution to mirror the language of the 2nd 
Amendment of the United States Constitution, ensuring clarity and consistency in the 
protection of the people’s right to keep and bear arms. In addition, licensed concealed carry 
holders may legally carry firearms in public sporting venues, including, but not limited to, ball 
parks, arenas, sporting events, airshows, car shows, rodeos, or if financed in part with taxpayer 
funds or hold tax exemptions. 
g) Pass unrestricted Constitutional Carry by amending Article 1, Section 23, of the Texas 
Constitution by removing, “but the Legislature shall have power, by law, to regulate the 
wearing of arms, with a view to prevent crime.” 
h) Support an amendment that would allow for the recall of any elected officials in the state of 
Texas for misconduct while in office, or failure to properly represent their constituents. 
3. 
Enforce the Constitution Article 4, Section 4: The sovereignty of this State requires the protections 
afforded under Article 4, Section 4, of the Constitution, and any failing thereof authorizes the Governor 
of this State or the Legislature to declare an invasion, which shall be met with the full force of this 
State. 
4. 
No Foreign Law: No foreign law, contract, or judgment arising from any foreign state whose laws 
violate fundamental constitutional rights shall be honored or enforced by any Texas court. 
5. 
Judicial Overreach: All attempts by the judiciary to rule in areas not constitutionally granted to the 
judiciary, including abuses of the “Commerce Clause,” the “General Welfare Clause,” and the 
“Supremacy Clause,” should be nullified. Any federal enforcement activities that occur in Texas shall 
be conducted under the authority of the county sheriff (SCOTUS ruling in 1997 Mack and Printz v. US). 
6. 
Limiting the Power of the Supreme Court: Judges do not define the roles of judges; Article 3, 
Section 2, defines the roles of judges. We support Congress’s limiting the power of the Supreme Court 
by invoking Article 3, Section 2, Clause 2, by “legislating exceptions and creating regulations“ to limit 
the cases for which the Supreme Court has jurisdiction. 
7. 
Amendments to the United States Constitution: We: 
a) Support term limits of twelve (12) years for federal offices of US Senate and US House of 
Representatives. 
b) Oppose “packing” (or enlarging) the US Supreme Court and support the pending “Keep Nine 
Amendment” as filed in the US Senate and the House of Representatives with bipartisan 
support. 
c) Support the repeal or the nullification of the 16th Amendment (Federal Income Tax). 
d) Support restoring state sovereignty with the repeal of the 17th Amendment of the US 
Constitution and the appointment of US Senators by the state legislatures. 
e) Support a change to the 14th Amendment to eliminate “birth tourism” or anchor babies by 
granting citizenship only to those with at least one biological parent who is a US citizen. 
f) Support a constitutional amendment making English the official language of the United States, 
and one of no more than two official languages of all US territories and other possessions. 
8. 
Executive Orders: We oppose all executive orders, whether by a president, a governor, or a local 
official, that go beyond administration of executive authority and have the effect of legislation. We call 
upon the Texas Legislature or local lawmakers to nullify such executive orders. 
Table of Contents

9. 
Limiting Overreaching State Government: We recognize that the sovereignty of this State and its 
citizenry has been imperiled and threatened by the ongoing overreach of state elected officials and 
agencies. We therefore call for the enforcement of Article 2 of the Texas Constitution and restoration of 
our liberty by the following: 
a) We must repeal and replace Texas Code 418. 
b) No form of government shall ever again implement mass lockdowns on the people, our 
businesses, or our churches. 
c) We oppose funding or implementation of any form of contact tracing. 
d) The State Constitution must be changed to require the Legislature come to session after a 
declared emergency lasting 30 days or more in five or more counties. 
e) The Texas Governor shall no longer use executive orders to create public policy or law and 
shall no longer have the power to close businesses or declare some as “essential” or “non-
essential.” 
f) The Governor‘s authority during an emergency shall not be delegated. 
10. Dereliction of Duty: The failure by a public official to discharge any duty shall be a violation of 
the terms of his or her oath of office, which shall constitute a crime, and upon conviction this crime 
shall be punishable by a fine or imprisonment, depending on the nature of the offense. Any entity or 
person who acts under the color of federal or state law to deprive a Texan of the rights or privileges 
insured by the federal and state constitutions shall be liable to the injured parties for redress, including 
monetary damages and injunctive relief, notwithstanding any preexisting immunities. 
Citizen Rights 
11. The Rights of a Sovereign People: We support the historic concept, established by our nation’s 
Founders, of limited civil government jurisdiction under the natural laws of God, and we oppose the 
concept that the state is sovereign over the affairs of men, the family, or the church. We believe that 
government properly exists by the consent of the governed and must be restrained from intruding into 
the freedoms of its citizens to include due process. The function of government is not to grant rights, 
but to protect the unalienable, God-given rights of life, liberty, property, and the pursuit of happiness of 
all, including the unborn. Texas shall keep the Texas Citizens Participation Act (TCPA) intact and 
preserve its broad scope and essential protections for 1st Amendment Rights. 
12. Protecting Constitutional Rights Regarding Age: There should be a single age of majority upon 
which, when reached, all citizens will be guaranteed their rights, duties, and privileges. 
13. National Popular Vote: The National Popular Vote Interstate Compact is a direct violation of 
Article 1, Section 10, and Article 2, Section 1, of the Constitution and shall be rejected by Texas and all 
its officials. We support the Electoral College. 
14. Habeas Corpus: Any federal suspension of the writ of habeas corpus against a Texas citizen shall 
be violative of the 10th Amendment, Texas sovereignty, sovereignty of the individual, and actionable by 
the state or the citizen. 
15. Census: In accordance with the United States Constitution, we support an actual count of United 
States citizens, and we oppose Census Bureau estimates and the collection of all other data. Illegal 
aliens must not be included in any census. 
16. Equal Rights Amendment: We call upon the Texas Legislature to adopt a resolution clarifying that 
the 1972 ratification by the 62nd Texas Legislature of the proposed Equal Rights Amendment to the 
United States Constitution was valid only through March 22, 1979. 
17. Parental Rights: The rights of parents are foundational to Western society and shall be respected, 
affirmed, and protected by the Texas Constitution and Texas Law. Furthermore, it is imperative that the 
Texas Legislature pass a Parental Rights Amendment to be added to the Texas Constitution in order to 
secure these rights for future generations. We call upon the Legislature to properly recognize and affirm 
the fundamental right of parents to make all decisions regarding the upbringing and control of their 
Table of Contents 
6
children in all aspects, especially in light of the grievous violations of the Texas education system. Any 
failure to recognize, protect, or honor these fundamental rights shall be actionable. No parent 
exercising any of these fundamental rights shall be prosecuted as domestic terrorists. 
18. Prayer, Bible, and Ten Commandments in Schools: We support affirmation of God, including 
prayer, the Bible, and the Ten Commandments being returned to our schools, courthouses, and other 
government buildings. 
19. The Right to Keep and Bear Arms: State and Federal Legislatures shall: 
a) Repeal and/or nullify the National Firearms Act of 1934 and the Gun Control Act of 1968. 
b) Nullify any gun laws that violate the 2nd Amendment or rights of due process. 
c) Support national reciprocity for gun ownership rights and the right to carry. 
d) Recognize the right of License to Carry holders to carry anywhere, off-duty or retired law 
enforcement personnel to carry anywhere, including any federal property accessible to the 
general public, including, but not limited to waterways, lakes, dams, and postal offices. 
e) Ensure that any of the above legislation shall not be construed as impinging on private 
property rights. 
f) Ensure individuals who have acted in justified defense should presumptively be immune from 
civil liability. 
g) Ensure tenants of leased premises should not be evicted for acting in justified self-defense. 
h) Require that financial service firms doing business in Texas do not record financial 
transactions using Merchant Category Codes (MCC) for purchases related to guns, 
ammunition, gun accessories, gun safes, gun range payments, gun range memberships, and 
other 2nd Amendment protected activities. The use of any such services for the tracking of 
these purchases shall be banned. 
i) Require that businesses or commercial property owners that prohibit licensed permit holders 
from carrying a firearm into their establishments assume liability for their safety since the 
owners are denying those persons the right to protect themselves. 
j) Republicans believe armor piercing ammunition and chemical dispensing devices (OC spray) 
are useful for defense and must be legalized in Texas. 
State Sovereignty 
20. State Sovereignty: Pursuant to Article 1, Section 1, of the Texas Constitution, the federal 
government has impaired our right of local self-government. Therefore, federally mandated legislation 
that infringes upon the 10th Amendment rights of Texas shall be ignored, opposed, refused, and 
nullified. Texas retains the right to secede from the United States, and the Texas Legislature should be 
called upon to pass a referendum consistent thereto and pass the Texas Sovereignty Act as filed in the 
88th Legislative Regular Session as HB 384.  
21. Concurrent Majority: The Legislature shall cause to be enacted a State Constitutional Amendment 
to add the additional criteria for election to a statewide office to include the majority vote of the 
counties with each individual county being assigned one vote allocated to the popular majority vote 
winner of each individual county. 
22. Unfunded and Under-Funded Mandates: Unfunded mandates and under-funded mandates are 
unacceptable. The State of Texas must fully fund, at a minimum, the following additional costs to local 
governments provided to all legal residents: 
a) Indigent criminal defense 
b) Inmate healthcare in jails 
c) Indigent burials and autopsies 
d) Veteran services offices 
23. Equal Protection for the Preborn: We urge lawmakers to enact legislation to abolish abortion by 
immediately securing the right to life and equal protection of the laws to all preborn children from the 
moment of fertilization, because abortion violates the United States Constitution by denying such 
persons the equal protection of the law.

24. Article 5 Convention of States: The Texas Legislature shall extend the call for a Convention of 
States to impose fiscal restraints on the federal government, limit the power and jurisdiction of the 
federal government, and limit the terms of office of federal officials and members of Congress.   
Business, Commerce, and Transportation 
Markets and Regulation 
25. Municipal Preemption: We encourage the Legislature to preempt local government efforts to 
interfere with the state’s sovereignty over business, employees, and property rights. This includes but is 
not limited to burdensome regulations on short-term rentals, plastic bags, sick leave, trees, and 
employee criminal screening. We support preemption of city ordinances which prohibit or penalize 
private charity to United States citizens. This excludes the handling of emergency orders. 
26. Licensing: We call upon the Texas Legislature to review all Texas Department of Licenses and 
Regulations (TDLR), business/professional licensing programs, and associated licensing for the 
purpose of abolishing or removing as many as reasonably possible and repealing those laws, rules, and 
regulations.  
a) Practice of Medicine: We support allowing any board-licensed medical graduate to practice 
medicine under the supervision of a full physician, just as Nurse Practitioners (NPs) and 
Physicians Assistants (PAs) are permitted to practice medicine under the supervision of a full 
physician. 
b) Practice of Law: We oppose mandatory State Bar membership. The Texas Bar may not collect 
any more dues unless it conducts a membership referendum and with more than two-thirds of 
all dues-paying members approve of the mandatory membership requirement. We support 
sanctions for those who weaponize and politicize the legal disciplinary process of Texas in 
attorney disciplinary matters. Texas should adopt a “clear and convincing” evidentiary 
standard instead of its current “preponderance of the evidence.” The State Bar of Texas may 
not try to influence judges, justices, judicial candidates, or associations. 
27. Reduce Business Regulations: We believe that the following businesses shall be minimally 
regulated at all levels. 
a) Federal Laws: 
i. Repeal Minimum Wage Law and prevailing wage laws. 
ii. Repeal Dodd-Frank. 
iii. Repeal Sarbanes-Oxley. 
iv. Repeal The Lacey Act.  
v. Texans should be able to buy beef and farm products directly from farmers without any 
FDA and USDA or other governmental agency regulations. 
vi. Mandatory sick or family leave. 
b) State Laws:  
i. Eliminate Blue laws.  
ii. Eliminate the three-tier alcohol system (production, distribution, and retail).  
iii. Mandatory sick or family leave. 
iv. Business licensing.  
v. Professional licensing. 
vi. Purchase of edible products from small farms.  
vii. Use of hemp as an agricultural commodity. 
28. Trade Agreements: We support free trade as a necessary component of American capitalism and of 
the United States’ influence in the world. However, all trade agreements between the Federal 
Government and other nations shall strictly adhere to the United States Constitution and require 
approval by two-thirds (2/3) of the Senate.

29. Origin Labeling: We urge that all food products entering the United States show not only the 
country of origin, but also the country that processed it, and the country that packaged it.  
a) All products created to be consumed by people or animals shall be labeled as “lab-grown” in 
“state” and “country.”  
b) Any products created for consumption by people or animals with insect parts/liquid shall be 
labeled as “insects included.” 
c) Texas Legislature should amend shipping laws for distilleries and breweries to match that of 
wine shipments that are allowed to and from Texas. All shipped wine must be in packages that 
are clearly labeled and show that the packages contain wine. It must be delivered by a 
business holding a Carrier’s Permit. Wine can be delivered to:  
i. The person who purchased it.  
ii. A recipient chosen in advance by the purchaser.  
iii. A person at the delivery address who is 21 or older, after the recipient presents a valid ID. 
30. Municipal Permitting: We call on the Texas Legislature to continue to streamline the building 
permitting process to ease burdens and costs on developers and consumers. We encourage the 
Legislature to monitor implementation of existing legislation that protects property development rights 
and to close loopholes that cities are using to circumvent these laws. We oppose retroactive rulemaking 
and changing the rules on developments that have already been issued permits. Unused landfill permits 
issued by the Texas Commission of Environmental Quality shall automatically expire after 10 years. 
31. Texas Resistance to The Great Reset: Texas should continue to pass legislation needed to protect 
the citizens of Texas from corporate violation of their rights in the Great Reset/Environmental, Social, 
and Governance (ESG) scheme as follows:  
a) Ban companies and corporations that attempt to suppress funding for Texas industries from 
doing business with the State of Texas and its subdivisions.  
b) Make it illegal for banks and financial institutions operating in Texas to make lending 
decisions based on anything other than financial concerns. The model for such legislation shall 
be the Fair Access to Financial Services rule promulgated by President Trump’s Office of the 
Comptroller of the Currency, a rule that was immediately suspended by the current occupant 
of the White House.  
c) Add penalties in Texas law for corporations operating in Texas that lead or participate in 
boycotts against Texas due to legislative action to protect the rights of Texans to decline 
vaccination, protect the unborn, stop the teaching of Critical Race Theory in schools, compete 
in sports with only those of their own biological gender, or to protect children and juveniles 
against sexual organ mutilation, hormones, and puberty blockers designed to fake transition 
from one gender to another.  
d) Consider the expansion or use of existing Texas anti-trust law to prohibit collusion between 
woke corporations to cancel/drive others out of business. 
e) Enact legislation protecting the property, rights, and freedoms of citizens and businesses in 
Texas by eliminating the priority given to the largest financial institutions to investor assets 
under the Uniform Commercial Code. 
32. Texas Currencies: Texas should recognize the natural right to use currency of choice in the Texas 
Bill of Rights and provide choices for ordinary Texans to use gold and silver in everyday transactions. 
The State of Texas shall prohibit the use of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDC) for use as legal 
tender to conduct private and commercial transactions or to settle debts, public or private. The State of 
Texas does not recognize the authority of the Federal Reserve Bank or the United States Treasury to 
create or implement Central Bank Digital Currencies as legal tender consistent with the provisions 
delegated to the Federal Government under Article 1, Section 8, of the Constitution of the United States 
of America. 
33. Patent Protection: We support reversing State and Federal legislation and court decisions that have 
damaged patent rights for Texas independent inventors and startups. These actions include abolishing 
administrative tribunals and restoring injunctive relief, thus restoring the United States patent system 
and driving America back to leading the world technologically, economically, and militarily.

Retirement, Savings, Unions 
34. Government Accountability: We call upon the Texas Legislature to eliminate all special collective 
bargaining statutes for public employees and to hold all public servants accountable to taxpayers 
through existing civil statutes. We oppose any distribution of taxpayer dollars to unions.  
35. Social Security Privatization: We support privatization of the Social Security system to lift the rate 
of return workers obtain on retirement contributions and boost national saving and economic growth. 
We also support removal of the “Windfall Elimination Provision” which punishes teachers and 
government workers (legislation pending), and encourage process simplification for Teacher 
Retirement System members to file for, and receive, benefits. 
36. Rural and Volunteer Fire Departments: We urge Congress to overturn the rules of the United 
States Department of Labor restricting volunteerism by paid firefighters and emergency medical 
technician personnel and to support protections similar to those provided to National Guardsmen for 
service during declared emergencies. 
37. Employee Stock Ownership Plans (ESOPs): We support maximum economic opportunity for all 
citizens and believe that legal limits on employee ownership of Texas firms by Employee Stock 
Ownership Plan (ESOP) trusts must be eliminated. We also believe that changes in ownership from 
private individuals to a majority ownership by an ESOP must not create disadvantages when doing 
business with the State of Texas or political subdivisions of the State. We believe the State of Texas 
should encourage the creation of more ESOPs by making information easily available to businesses 
located in Texas.  
38. Unions: We support legislation requiring labor unions to obtain consent of the union member 
before that member’s dues can be used for political purposes. We oppose card check. Texas should 
prohibit governmental entities from collecting dues for labor unions through deductions from public 
employee paychecks. We also encourage the adoption of a National Right to Work Act.  
Energy and Environment 
39. Utilities: We support free-market solutions for providing resilient and reliable utilities. The State 
of Texas shall require electric companies that buy electrical production from private citizens on their 
homes to provide equitable credits for overproduction, to be applied during periods of underproduction; 
such credits should be allowed to accumulate indefinitely.  
40. Proposed Water District (MUD): In addition to those who have lived inside a proposed water 
district for the statutorily required minimum six months prior to an election to approve water districts, 
the Texas Legislature should amend the standards for approval of a water district, which is the 
precursor to a Municipal Utility District (MUD), to include any registered voter who has resided on a 
property within one thousand (1,000) feet from the proposed property line for at least the same amount 
of time. 
41. Power Grid: We urge the Texas Legislature to pass legislation to harden the Texas Electric Grid 
increasing capacity and preparedness for all hazards, including: 
a) Cyberattacks on the grid‘s computerized command and control system. 
b) Physical attacks on substations and major high-voltage transformers. 
c) Geomagnetic storms created by solar flares. 
d) Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP).  
e) Extreme weather events, both cold and hot. 
f) Texas Electric Grid shall remain independent from the United States power grid system. 
42. Carbon Tax: We oppose any and all efforts to implement a carbon tax. 
43. Environment: We oppose environmentalism, or “climate change“ initiatives, that obstruct 
legitimate business interests and private property use, including the regulatory use limitation and 
confiscation by governmental agencies. We support the reclassification of carbon dioxide as a non-
Table of Contents 
10
pollutant, abolition of the Environmental Protection Agency, and repeal of the Endangered Species Act. 
We oppose President Biden’s Executive Order 14008, “Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and 
Abroad,” the “America the Beautiful” Initiative, also known as the 30 x 30 program, and all “climate 
justice“ initiatives. We support Texas Land Application Permits (TLAP) and oppose TLAP conversion 
to Waste Water Treatment Plants (WWTP) that allow for partially treated sewage to be dumped into our 
creeks and lakes. We oppose cloud seeding and geoengineering of any kind. 
44. Flooding Mitigation, Hurricane, and Early Warning of Impending Disaster: We support the 
immediate study, implementation, and construction of projects that will: 
a) Address river, bayou, reservoir, and other flood threats to public and private property. 
b) Seek the input of those most likely to be affected by a casualty to public and private property, 
to include infrastructure and facilities that affect national security. 
c) Address the risk of storm or tidal surge that affects critical industries along the Texas Gulf 
Coast. 
d) Create an early warning system that will immediately alert residents to an impending flood, 
wind, or casualty weather event. 
e) Establish regional flood control districts where necessary for counties to resolve joint flooding 
issues. 
f) Provide funds to complete these projects from federal, state, and local funds. 
g) Government boards responsible for flood mitigation shall be elected and not appointed. 
Governments at all levels must work together to avoid the historical bent to push projects, safety, and 
implementation into the future. Projects must be of most urgent priority now to avoid further trauma; 
loss of life; loss of personal, government, and business wealth; and diminution of the tax base.  
45. Tidelands and Resources: We assert that the State of Texas and all coastal states shall enjoy and 
maintain jurisdiction and control of their offshore waters up to the international water boundaries, as 
well as state inland waterways, regarding all natural resources therein, and that the federal government 
shall not set limits on harvesting or taking natural resources therein, nor allow foreign entities to 
harvest or take such natural resources therein, including minerals, game, fisheries, and hydrocarbons. 
Also, we demand that no entity shall usurp Texas’ original tideland boundaries.  
46. Water Resources: We support tying surface rights of ownership to groundwater rights of 
ownership. We support regulations that may put limits on a person’s capture and use of groundwater, if 
such use will negatively impact adjoining owners’ use of their groundwater for private wells, their 
water supply, or agricultural use. We support innovative solutions to meet growing water demand in 
Texas, including development and desalination of seawater and both private and Texas-owned brackish 
waters. 
47. Energy Production: We support free-market solutions and the immediate removal of government 
barriers and direct subsidies to the production, transportation, reformulation, refining, and distribution 
of energy. We oppose federally directed plans and proposals that favor renewable energy sources that 
may constitute a nuisance, or otherwise have a substantially negative impact on neighboring 
landowners, including harming property values of our neighborhoods, farms, and ranch areas. We fully 
support and encourage greater energy production in the Permian Basin and throughout Texas, as well as 
the necessary policies and infrastructure investment in roads, pipelines, and ports. These steps will 
support Texas workers and help America’s energy security, instead of increasing our reliance on foreign 
governments that do not benefit America or our allies. We urge the state to require minimum firebreak 
setbacks on solar and battery facilities for wildfire prevention mitigation. 
48. Energy Innovation: Texas should take advantage of its independent grid and mines to build and 
operate traditional and next-generation nuclear energy plants. To keep the federal government from 
interfering, the Texas Legislature shall establish a nuclear regulatory authority and ensure that the 
facilities and their supply chain of components and fuel remains in state and off federally claimed land. 
The Texas Legislature shall begin the process of creating a Strategic Petroleum Reserve. The Texas 
Legislature must ensure the safety of these reserves from enemies, foreign and domestic.

Transportation 
49. Freedom to Travel: Lawmakers must take action immediately to protect drivers from government-
mandated remote kill switches that are currently scheduled to be in every vehicle starting in 2026, to 
prevent this unconstitutional surveillance of drivers and the weaponization of this technology against 
Texas drivers. We oppose climate mandates like Net Zero, Vision Zero, or declarations of a climate 
emergency that threaten our freedom to travel, impose any sort of state or federal mileage tax, or 
institute diversity, equity, and inclusion policies on taxpayers and drivers. We oppose anti-car measures 
that punish those who choose to travel alone in their vehicles. We also oppose mandates such as 
autonomous vehicle technology, digital IDs, digital license plates, or other mandates that restrict, 
control, or prohibit driving (particularly gas-powered vehicles), shrink auto capacity, or intentionally 
clog vehicle lanes to force deference to pedestrian, bike, and mass transit options. 
50. Vehicle Taxes and Inspections: At the point of sale, taxes shall be based on the actual price of the 
vehicle or trailer. The Legislature shall implement a method and structure so that owners of electric 
vehicles pay their ongoing fair share of highway and road construction, maintenance, and usage. Only 
commercial vehicles will be required to complete a vehicle inspection. 
51. Toll Roads: We call on the Texas Legislature to abolish existing toll roads and prohibit future 
construction, returning responsibility for road construction and maintenance to the appropriate 
jurisdiction. 
52. High-Speed Rail: Taxpayer money shall not fund or subsidize high-speed rail, nor shall eminent 
domain be used in the construction of high-speed rail. 
53. Prohibit Abortion Transportation Across State Lines: We support legislation to prohibit the use of 
any government funds, as well as the transportation of pregnant women across Texas’ state lines, for the 
purpose of procuring an elective abortion and for the provision of a private right of action against all 
persons and organizations who aid and abet in the harming of the woman, and the killing of her pre-
born child. 
COVID Response 
54.  Jobs Are Essential: We urge the Texas Legislature to adopt legislation that recognizes and 
establishes all businesses and jobs as essential and a fundamental right. Governments do not have the 
authority to determine what entities are essential during an emergency. Businesses shall not be held 
liable for any customer who frequents their business and later is confirmed to test positive for a 
contagious illness. 
Privacy, Information Freedom, Internet 
55. Doxing and Swatting: We recommend the Legislature consider modifying existing state law to 
take into account the implications of doxing, which results in harm to one’s person or business, and 
swatting, a criminal harassment tactic of deceiving an emergency service into sending a police or 
emergency response team to another person’s address.  
56. Regulating the Internet: We oppose efforts to implement net neutrality on internet service 
providers. We oppose all efforts to further regulate the internet in the United States or internationally, or 
to impose taxation upon internet digital goods and services. 
57. Artificial Intelligence Protections: We believe that each person is the rightful owner of his/her 
name, likeness, voice, knowledge, opinions, etc., and we support the individual’s right to protect his/her 
identity, name, image, data, information, and likeness from being collected or otherwise used by data 
brokers, or artificial intelligence applications without written consent. Each person has the right to 
know who is collecting information, when and how the information is being collected, and how the 
information is being used or sold. Each person has the right to opt out of any data collection or data 
use. 
Table of Contents 
12
58. Personal Data Privacy: We demand that all rights to privacy that individuals have in their homes 
shall be extended to all digital data via the use of strong public key encryption technologies. We call 
upon Texas to prohibit vendors of the State of Texas and its subdivisions from selling or sharing data 
captured in providing services to Texans. We support laws limiting the ways in which internet 
providers, data brokers, electronic applications, websites, schools, government entities, and others may 
access the electronic communications or documents of all Texans. We support a no-cost smart meter 
opt out for utility customers, or the provision of an auditable option to limit storing data to only once 
per monthly bill cycle. 
59. Social Media Freedom and Responsibility: We call on our Congressional Delegation to push for 
reform of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act to limit the ability of online social media 
platforms to censor the speech of citizens in the new digital town square, which these media platforms 
currently control. We support Texas legislative efforts, such as HB 20 of the 87th Second Called 
Session, that afford Texas residents the power to sue big tech companies for targeting and censorship. 
We also support stripping Section 230 immunity from sites that knowingly publish obscene and 
indecent material, particularly advertisement, promotion, presentation, distribution, or solicitation of 
child sexual abuse material, thus opening these sites to criminal and civil liability for the content posted 
on their platforms. 
60. Cyber Security Self-Defense: We support “hack-backs,” defined as counterattacks aimed at 
disabling or collecting evidence against a perpetrator, as a legitimate form of self-defense of persons 
and organizations to ensure their cyber security. The right to defend oneself in our current era must be 
expanded to preserve the safety, property, and livelihood of Texans.  
61. American Workers First: Prioritize American workers in the workforce.   
Finance 
Spending Restraint 
Note: Letters “F,” “S” and “L” at the end of each plank in this section denote financial impact related to 
Federal, State, and Local factors. 
62. Government Spending and Taxation: We believe in the principles of constitutionally limited 
government based on federalist principles. Government spending is out of control at the federal, state, 
and local levels, and action is needed to reduce spending. We urge the Legislature to amend the Texas 
Constitution and State statute with a stricter spending limitation based on US Census population 
growth plus inflation and apply the new limit to Texas’ total government budget. We call on the Texas 
Legislature to freeze state spending. Any budget surplus shall be applied to a Texas Health Savings 
Account (HSA) until such time as we have exited Medicaid. Additionally, we support imposing a 
spending cap on all local government jurisdictions to be bound by the metric of population and 
inflation. (F, S, L) 
63. Economic Stabilization Fund: Use of the Economic Stabilization Fund shall be limited to its 
intended purposes of preventing tax increases during economic downturns and responding to 
unforeseen disasters. Six months after such events occur, excess funds shall first be deposited into the 
Texas Health Savings Account (HSA), and then go towards property tax relief. (S) 
64. Government Pensions: The Texas Legislature shall enact new rules to begin to transition 
government pensions for public sector employees from a defined benefit pension to a defined 
contribution retirement plan similar to a 403(b). (S, L) 
65. Gambling: We oppose any expansion of gambling, including legalized casino gambling. We 
oppose and call for a veto of any budget that relies on expansion of legalized casino gambling of any 
type or size, whether as a standalone business or partnered with any other business or resort, as a 
method of finance. We call on all Republican legislators to decline campaign contributions from 
Table of Contents 
13
gambling PACs and lobbyists and oppose any effort from the House leadership or members of the 
House Calendars Committee to pressure members to vote for expanded gambling. We also call for the 
repeal of the vague “fuzzy animal” exception to Texas’ anti-gambling laws that allow non-cash prizes 
to be awarded based on use of eight-liner slot machines. (S) 
66. Truth in Taxation: We urge that taxes established for a particular purpose shall not be used for any 
other purpose. Tax revenue derived from gasoline taxes and all other taxes or fees on our vehicles 
(including vehicle sales tax) shall only be used for road construction and maintenance, and shall not be 
diverted to any other use, including mass transit, rail, restrictive lanes, and bicycle paths. (S, L) 
67. Public Posting: We support all government entities compiling and publicly posting their current 
debt, future obligations, financial statements, check registers, and all government contracts on their 
official websites. (F, S, L)  
a) Compiled information shall be presented in a table with the principal, estimated interest, and 
estimated combined principal, interest required for full payment of the proposed bonds, the 
principal, estimated interest, estimated combined principal, and interest required for full 
payment of all outstanding bonds, as of the date the political subdivision adopted the debt 
obligation order. 
b) Voter approval is for a maximum spend, not a blank check for all projects on a list. An 
approved bond amount will include principal, interest, and a contingency amount for overruns. 
68. Repeal Taxes: We support abolishing the following: 
a) Estate tax (commonly known as the Death Tax. (F) 
b) Inventory taxes. (S, L) 
c) Business franchise taxes. (F, S, L) 
d) Taxes on phone and internet services. (F, S, L) 
e) Affordable Care Act Home Sales Tax. (F) 
f) Personal property tax. (S, L) 
69. Federal Taxes: We support elimination of all federal income taxes. Until such time, we support the 
repeal of the Required Minimum Distribution from qualified retirements accounts and institutions. (F) 
70. Let Texans Run Texas: The Texas Legislature shall pass legislation that prohibits political 
subdivisions of Texas and State agencies from accepting federal funds that violate Texas law. Texas 
government should resist unconstitutional federal acts, violations of federal border laws, and the use of 
financial pressure by globalist institutions that seek to destroy everything Texans hold dear and usurp 
the political power of Texas. Such resistance should include stopping unconstitutional federal acts in 
Texas, defense of the border by Texas without interference by the federal government, and the 
prohibition of the use of globalist financial pressure to destroy Texas businesses. (S) 
71. Prevent Hotel Occupancy Tax (HOT) Abuse: The Texas Legislature is requested to restrict the 
Hotel Occupancy Tax for Texas cities to prevent the display, promulgation, and promotion of obscene 
or pornographic materials and acts. (S, L) 
School Finance and Property Taxation 
72. Elected Officials’ Salaries: State, county, or local elected officials shall not be eligible to receive 
salary or benefit increases that they vote on. Voters must otherwise approve such benefits by a two-
thirds (2/3) majority of those voting, and only if 20% of all registered voters in the district cast ballots. 
(S, L) 
73. Impact Fees and Management Districts: We oppose the creation of management or special 
purpose districts with the authority to impose taxes and bonded debt, and we oppose the use of eminent 
domain by these districts. (S, L) 
74. Permanent School Fund: We oppose any effort to remove State Board of Education authority over 
the Permanent School Fund, whose constitutionally intended purpose is to fund SBOE-approved 
instructional materials. (S) 
Table of Contents 
14
75. Ax the Property Tax: We support replacing the property tax system for businesses and individuals 
with an alternative other than the income tax, and requiring voter approval to increase the overall tax 
burden. We demand the Legislature to immediately develop and implement a transition plan that is a 
net tax cut. (S, L) 
76. Property Tax Relief: We support these incremental steps toward the ultimate abolition of property 
tax: 
a) Amend the school finance formulas to reduce the Local Fund Assignment so that it is phased 
out completely in twelve (12) years, funding Tier I entirely from state revenue, and ending the 
Robin Hood system of school finance. (S, L)  
b) Replace the appraisal system with a system that values property at the purchase price, thus 
negating the need for an appraisal district. (S, L) 
c) Require appraisal districts to publish the amount of property taxes and appraisals attributable 
to each rental unit. (S, L) 
d) Limit annual increase on Texas ISD property taxes that Texas ISD property tax revenues shall 
increase no more than the no-new-revenue rate of 2% per year. This increase shall include the 
addition of any and all school bond issuances, existing and future, within the school district. 
(S, L) 
e) Close the loophole called the “Unused Increment Rate,” which allows taxing entities to bypass 
recently added limits to increases in property taxes. (S, L) 
f) The Texas Legislature should require the Texas Comptroller and the Texas Education Agency 
(TEA) to provide a report, as ordered by the courts, of the spending of funds earmarked for 
accountability, and to disclose any surplus. (S, L) 
g) Account for New Minerals so that the New Minerals are treated in the same fashion as New 
Improvements (that are added to the tax base) when calculating the no-new-revenue tax rate 
for counties. (S, L) 
h) No property taxes shall be collected on private properties, including homesteads, fees simple, 
and land patented lands, and excluding leases, licenses, and permits on publicly owned lands. 
(S, L) 
77. Administrative Bloat Is Not Transformative: We call on Texas school administrators to deliver 
more education for our dollars, instead of nonstop lobbying for more dollars for education. At a 
minimum, 80% “Pareto Principle” of revenue should be spent in the classroom. We oppose the 
underhanded strategy of making cuts to visible frontline teaching positions instead of to administrators 
and overhead. Total compensation for all administrative staff should be posted publicly. (S, L) 
Opposition to Market-Distorting Tax and Fiscal Subsidies 
78. No Corporate Welfare: We encourage government to divest its ownership of all businesses that 
should be run in the private sector. We oppose all bailouts of and subsidies to domestic and foreign 
government entities, states, and for all businesses, public and private. We agree with the Texas 
Constitution’s requirement for fair and uniform taxation and oppose special treatment or tax breaks for 
favored industries or companies. We call for repeal or sunset of existing subsidy or special-interest tax 
exemptions, including the Special Events Trust Fund program, the Texas Enterprise Fund, Moving 
Image Industry Incentive Program, and lab-grown meat incentives, and now request repeal of Chapter 
403.601 of the Texas Tax Code.  Tax dollars shall not be used to fund the building of stadiums for 
professional or semi-professional sports teams, unless otherwise approved by a two-thirds (2/3) 
majority of those voting and only if 20% of all registered voters in the district cast ballots. (S, L) 
79. Ban Public Facility Corporations: The Texas Legislature should eliminate the ability of local 
governments to set up public facility corporations. These corporations allow local governments to 
spend taxpayer money without voter approval, thereby increasing debt and taxpayer burden. 
Table of Contents 
15
80. Eliminate Federal Activity: We call upon the Federal Government to stop the following: 
a) Community Reinvestment Act. (F) 
b) Funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. (F) 
c) Ownership of or insurance related to Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae), 
Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac), and SLM Corporation (Sallie 
Mae). (F) 
d) College and university loan forgiveness. Failure of loan repayment shall fall to the colleges 
and universities or their respective endowment fund(s). (F, S) 
Transparency and Oversight 
81. End the Fed: We support abolishing the Federal Reserve. Until that is accomplished, we support 
additional accountability and transparency for the Federal Reserve System, including regular 
independent performance audits. (F) 
82. Robin Hood Accounting: We direct the Texas Legislature to have the Texas Comptroller of Public 
Accounts and Texas Education Agency provide a full accounting for the funds collected by recapture 
“Robin Hood” are spent to comply with the Texas Supreme Court-ordered mandate for Wealth 
Equalization. 
83. Right to Use Gold, Silver, Cash, and Cash Substitutes: We support Texas in exercising its 
constitutional right (Article 1, Section 10) to declare gold and silver as legal tender, and to authorize the 
ability to transact, transmit, or exchange such gold and silver bullion by physical and/or electronic 
means, or written instruction. 
To further that right, we support legislation for Texas to utilize the Texas Bullion Depository for 
persons to buy and hold gold and silver bullion and electronically transact with it as money, essentially 
allowing debit card transactions to spend gold and silver as functional legal tender. The State of Texas 
should protect that money (and its use) from capital gains taxation at both the state and federal level. 
No government shall prohibit or encumber the ownership or holding of any form or amount of money 
or other currency. We support a ban on any form of social credit system based on programmable/ 
trackable digital currencies including Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs). (S) 
Education 
Parents’ Rights 
84. School Choice: We support further empowering all Texas families to choose from public, private, 
charter, or homeschool options for their children’s education and funding which shall follow the student 
with no strings attached. We oppose regulations on homeschooling or the curriculum of private or 
religious schools and believe a constitutional amendment should be adopted accordingly. In lieu of 
funding, citizens may use property tax exemptions. 
85. Parents’ Rights in Education: Parents are the primary educators and disciplinarians of their 
children, to which all other entities are inferior. The fundamental parental rights of parents to make 
decisions regarding the upbringing and control of their children in all aspects, but especially in all 
aspects of the Texas education system, shall be recognized, affirmed, and protected by changes to the 
Texas Constitution and Texas law, including codifying the protections currently existing in the Texas 
Family and Education Codes. No public service entity nor its agents, district personnel, community 
partners, guest speakers, or District Board of Trustees shall infringe upon these rights. We call for the 
development and dissemination of the Parent’s Right to Know and Consent booklet that contains 
pertinent state and federal law. 
Table of Contents 
16
86. Enforcement of Parental Rights and Students’ Rights: We implore the Legislature to create 
enforcement measures for violations of Texas laws, while prioritizing parental rights, especially the 
right to protect one’s own children from harm. Enforcement mechanisms must include investigation 
and referral authority for criminal, civil, and other disciplinary actions. We urge the Legislature to 
create an independent Office of Inspector General of Education, appointed by a majority vote of the 
elected State Board of Education, to investigate waste, fraud, and abuse, particularly sexual abuse of 
students, violations of parental rights, and student due process rights when they occur in a school 
setting. Such position shall have authority to refer any matter to the Texas Attorney General for further 
investigation and prosecution, if warranted.  
87. Sexual Education, Health-Related Education, and the Classroom to Clinic Pipeline: We demand 
that the Legislature pass a law prohibiting the teaching of sex education, sexual health, or sexual choice 
or identity in any government school in any grade whatsoever, or disseminating or permitting the 
dissemination by any party of any material regarding the same. All government schools are prohibited 
from contracting with or making any payment to any third party for material concerning any of the 
above topics. Until this prohibition goes into effect, sexual education shall only utilize sexual risk 
avoidance programs and promote abstinence outside of marriage. Before a student may be provided 
with any health-related instruction, human sexuality, or family planning instruction, the district must 
obtain the written consent of the student’s parent or guardian. Written consent of the student’s parent or 
guardian must include the district’s full disclosure of all guest speakers and referral resources that 
students will be exposed to (opt-in status). 
88. Prohibiting Grooming of Minors: We request that the Texas Legislature pass legislation that 
requires Texas schools, libraries, and contracted vendors to filter and vet inappropriate and harmful 
content, such as pornography. We support the passage of a law even more comprehensive than the 
Florida law that prohibits instruction in sexual orientation and gender identity ideology in government 
schools and libraries. We believe any school employees or contractors responsible for exposing a 
student to inappropriate material or engaging in inappropriate conduct with students should have their 
teaching license revoked, forfeit their pension, and be criminally prosecuted with enhanced penalties. 
We call on the Legislature to prohibit school districts from abusing their District of Innovation status to 
avoid parental rights’ laws or restrictions on human sexuality education. 
89. Healthcare in Public Schools: Legislators shall prohibit reproductive healthcare services, 
including mental health counseling or referrals to outside health services or clinics, and distribution or 
demonstration of condoms and contraception through public schools. We support parents’ right to 
know, and consent to choose, without penalty, which healthcare medications and mental health services 
are administered to their minor children. We support requiring informed consent of parents before any 
school-based mental health assessments or interventions are performed; the district must obtain written 
parental consent. Written parental consent must include the district’s full disclosure of the business or 
clinic students will be referred to for healthcare or mental health services (opt-in status). 
90. Religious Freedom and Government Schools: We demand school administrators and officials 
protect the rights of students and staff to pray and engage in religious speech, individually or in groups, 
on school property, without government interference. We urge the Legislature and the State Board of 
Education to require instruction on the Bible, servant leadership, and Christian self-governance. We 
support the use of chaplains in schools to counsel and give guidance from a traditional biblical 
perspective based on Judeo-Christian principles with the informed consent of a parent. 
Curriculum 
91. Instructional Excellence: The educational system should focus on imparting essential academic 
knowledge, qualities of good citizenship, practical skills, and self-sufficiency. We support, without 
exception, requiring Texas public schools to be fully transparent with parents regarding everything to 
Table of Contents 
17
which their child is or will be exposed. Curriculum of Instructional Excellence shall include the 
following: 
a) Language arts with phonics-based reading instruction, spelling, grammar, classical literature, 
and cursive writing.  
b) Civics, which includes passing the US Citizenship and Immigration Services test prior to 
graduation. 
c) In mathematics, we support stronger emphasis on the TEKS 2nd and 3rd grade math standards 
to recall addition/multiplication facts “with automaticity,” which significantly enables students 
to better comprehend subsequent material. 
d) In science, we support objective teaching of scientific method, practices, and theories 
including the complexity of life origins and the changing climate throughout geologic history. 
These concepts shall be taught as challengeable scientific theories subject to change as new 
data is produced. Teachers and students shall discuss the strengths and weaknesses of these 
theories openly, without fear of retribution or discrimination. 
e) In computer science, we support instruction in programming and introducing discrete math 
(logic, counting, probability, number theory, recursion, graph theory) to supplement it. 
f) Social studies, including geography, economics, and US and world history. Such instruction 
shall focus on American exceptionalism, the benefits of the free-enterprise system, and the 
consistent failures of socialism and communism.  
g) We support education in the arts and music and building critical thinking skills, including 
logic, rhetoric, and analytical sciences. We support quality vocational educational training that 
imparts skills needed for meaningful post-graduation employment.  
h) We encourage more participation in academic competitions to complement the curriculum, to 
think critically and creatively, and to motivate students as they acquire higher levels of 
knowledge. 
92. Founding Documents in High School: We support a high school-level curriculum for the study of 
American history that is heavily weighted toward the study of original founding documents, including 
the Declaration of Independence, the United States Constitution, the Constitutional Convention, the 
Federalist Papers, the Anti-Federalist Papers, Jefferson’s Letter to the Danbury Baptists, and other 
Founders’ writings.  
93. American Identity and Heritage: We favor strengthening our common American identity and 
preserving our heritage and culture. We reject Critical Race Theory as a Marxist ideology that seeks to 
undermine the system of law and order itself and reduce individuals to a group identity. To facilitate the 
appreciation of our American identity, the contrast between freedom and the tyrannical history of 
socialism/communism throughout history must be taught. Government schools must display the United 
States and Texas flags, and require the Pledges of Allegiance daily to instill patriotism. Other flags 
promoting progressive agendas should be prohibited from being displayed at government schools. 
Students shall have the right to display patriotic items on their person as well as on school property.  
94. National Core Curriculum: We oppose the use of national or international standards in the State of 
Texas (i.e., International Baccalaureate, Common Core, any remnants of CSCOPE, United Nations 
Inclusion, National Sexuality Education Standards, and SIECUS, etc.). We strongly urge the Texas 
Legislature to replace the STAAR accountability test with one of the dozens of group-administered 
achievement tests that meet the Texas statutory and State Board of Education (SBOE) requirements 
related to the relevance of data used to compute state and national norms for the assessments. We also 
oppose the modification of college entrance exams to reflect any national core philosophies as well as 
use of Social Emotional Learning (SEL) programs, and other quasi-therapeutic programs in schools. 
Any school district that violates state law banning the use of a national core curriculum or standards 
shall lose all state funding until said curricula or standards are removed and no longer used in 
classrooms.  
95. Illegal Aliens and Foreign Students: We believe the role of the public education system is to 
educate American citizens. We support the instruction of lawfully present residents and foreign 
Table of Contents 
18
exchange students at cost, but we oppose allowing illegal aliens into government schools and oppose 
the instruction of core classes in languages other than English. 
96. Oversight of Instructional Materials: All instructional materials and services paid for with state 
funds shall be vetted by the elected State Board of Education. We oppose appropriation of state funds 
for instructional content that has not been approved by the SBOE. This approval process must include 
public review, hearings, and the right to have factual errors corrected. We call on local districts to hold 
public hearings before deciding which instructional materials they will use including supplemental 
materials and programs. We support policies limiting students’ screen time and focusing on direct 
instruction. 
97. Education on Humanity and Dignity of the Preborn Child: We support requiring Texas students to 
learn about the humanity of the preborn child, including life-affirming definitions of life and the study 
of life, the concept that life begins at fertilization, milestones of fetal development at two-week 
gestational intervals, use of fetal baby models, witnessing of a live ultrasound, viewing the following 
videos: Meet Baby Olivia, A Glimpse Inside, and Miracle of Life, and (for high school students) the 
contents of the Woman’s Right to Know booklet. In addition, students should receive instruction on the 
dignity of human life and the principles of equal protection that were instituted in the Declaration of 
Independence and the United States Constitution that “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all 
men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that 
among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness,” as well as that “no State shall deprive any 
person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its 
jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.” 
Governance 
98. Abolish Department of Education: The Department of Education should be abolished because 
education is not an enumerated power of the federal government. We believe, therefore, the transfer of 
any of its functions to any other federal agency should be prohibited.  
99. Elected State Board of Education: We believe that the SBOE should continue to be an elected 
body consisting of fifteen members. The SBOE shall be staffed out of general revenue. Their 
responsibilities must include: 
a) Overseeing the Commissioner of Education. 
b) Maintaining constitutional authority over the Permanent School Fund. 
c) Maintaining authority over curriculum. 
d) The state adoption of all educational materials. This process must include public hearings. 
e) Granting, revoking, or amending open enrollment school charters. The SBOE should require 
charter school operators and board members to be American citizens. 
f) Teacher and administrator certification. We call for the abolition of the State Board for 
Educator Certification. 
100. School Security and Safety: We support passage of legislation encouraging local law enforcement 
to provide handgun safety and proficiency training for all educators and allowing LTC (License to 
Carry) holders to carry concealed firearms on all school campuses for security and protection purposes. 
101. Withdraw from Taxpayer-Funded Lobby Groups Like TASB: We believe locally elected school 
boards have a duty to ensure that the education provided reflects traditional Texas values, and have 
purview over policy, curriculum, and budget. Local independent school districts should sever all ties 
with taxpayer-funded lobby groups, including the Texas Association of School Boards (TASB), the 
Texas Association of School Administrators (TASA), and the Texas Association of Community Schools 
(TACS). We support prohibiting taxpayer dollars from being used to pay dues or any fees for these 
groups. Required training now provided by groups like the above-named organizations would instead 
be under the auspices of the State Board of Education, with funds appropriated for that purpose.  
102. Enforcement of Open Meetings: We demand requiring audio or video recordings and publication 
of minutes for closed sessions with employee and student identifiers redacted and allowing taxpayers to 
Table of Contents 
19
seek civil penalties for government school officials who violate the Texas Open Meetings Act. We 
believe an open meetings violation should be an affirmative defense to a charge of disrupting a public 
meeting.  
103. Gender Identity Ideology in Schools: The official position of the Texas schools shall be that there 
are only two genders: biological male and biological female, which are immutable and cannot be 
changed. We support the total prohibition of so-called social transitioning. We oppose transgender 
normalizing curriculum, library materials, and pronoun use. We support the passage of legislation that 
prohibits any course of instruction, unit of study, library materials, instructional materials, or any other 
curricular or extracurricular offering that adopts, supports, or promotes gender fluidity or transgender 
ideology in Texas government schools. We support the passage of legislation prohibiting school staff 
from engaging in sexualized drag activities, crossdressing, or transgenderism. We hold that biological 
men should compete only against other biological men and that biological women should compete only 
against other biological women in all school athletics.  
104. Parents’ Right to Local Control of Health Education: The Texas Department of State Health 
Services School Health program, the Centers for Disease Control “Whole School, Whole Community, 
Whole Child” Coordinated School Health program, and the Texas Education Agency undermine 
parental influence in education as authorized in Texas Education Code 28.004. The Legislature should 
defund and abolish Texas Department of State Health Services’ School Health Program, the Texas 
School Health Advisory Council (SHAC), and repeal Texas Education Code 38.013, Texas Education 
Code 38.014, and Texas Administrative Code 102.1031. Texas law should remove and prohibit 
websites, marketing, training, and policy recommendations from Texas Department of State Health 
Services and Texas Education Agency Coordinated School Health programs to local schools, teachers, 
and local School Health Advisory Councils.  
Until the legislature removes sex education from the curriculum of public schools, the State of Texas 
should adopt changes to Texas Education Code 28.004 requiring: 
a) At least 50% of the SHAC appointees to be parents of students within the district and who are 
not themselves or related to district employees. 
b) At least 50% of the parent officials to be present for any and all business to be conducted and 
be open to the public. 
Higher Education 
105. College Tuition and Student Loan Reform: College costs are out of control, and reform is urgently 
needed. We support freezing public spending on higher education until waste and administrative costs 
are reduced, and we support withholding public funding to state institutions that violate or promote the 
violation of state law. We support implementation of the following reforms: 
a) We call for the Texas Legislature to freeze tuition and fees at state colleges and universities.  
b) We oppose mass cancellation of student loan obligations. We call upon Congress to end the 
federal student loan program. 
c) We support requiring universities to eliminate tuition set-asides and any other programs that 
redistribute the costs of education among students or charge students different tuition rates 
based on household income.  
d) We oppose in-state tuition and financial aid for illegal aliens and support the elimination of the 
TEXAS grant. 
e) We support limiting international undergraduate and graduate student enrollment at Texas 
colleges and universities to no more than 5% of the student body. We support a total 
prohibition on students who are members of the Chinese Communist Party. 
106. Defund Political Correctness, Fund and Support Western Civilization Instruction: We believe 
colleges and universities should reject diversity as understood by the Left and instead promote diversity 
of thought in order to reverse the Left-wing politicization of higher education. We support the 
following perspectives and actions at Texas colleges, universities, and secondary schools: 
Table of Contents 
20
a) Like Hillsdale College, we agree that state universities “should value the merit of each unique 
individual, rather than succumbing to the discriminatory trend of so-called social justice and 
multicultural diversity, which judges individuals not as individuals, but as members of a group 
which pits one group against other competing groups in divisive power struggles.” 
b) We oppose any state funding or graduation requirements for divisive curricula inconsistent 
with the above, including Marxist, anti-American, Critical Race Theory (CRT), 
multiculturalism, Social and Emotional Learning (SEL), or diversity, equity, and inclusion 
courses. 
c) We oppose using public funds for homosexuality, transgender, or diversity, equity, and 
inclusion centers, employees, or programs. 
d) Public universities should be required to create a comprehensive program of instruction in 
Western Civilization, American Institutions, national and state heritage, Keynesian versus 
Austrian economics, and free-market liberty principles. Successful participation in this 
program should be required for graduation. 
107. Campus Speech: We urge the Texas Legislature to protect the 1st Amendment rights of those on 
college campuses in the practice their faith, the formation and governance of their organizations, and in 
speech. We recognize that vandalism and physical threats to individuals are not protest, and we 
adamantly oppose riots, encampments, and other activities intended to destroy property or endanger the 
safety of students and staff. 
108. Eliminate Tenure: We support abolishing the system of tenure in academia and advocate replacing 
it with a merit-based system for teacher retention.  
109. Equal Access: All Texas students shall have equal access to all state-supported university 
admissions, grants, scholarships, and loans, based upon measurable academic criteria. We support the 
suspension of federal funding from universities that prohibit military recruitment on campus. We 
support allowing homeschool and private school students to compete as individuals in UIL academic 
competitions and to be eligible for associated scholarships. The Classic Learning Test (CLT) should be 
accepted for purposes of admission and weighed in the same manner as institutions weigh scores 
achieved on the ACT or SAT. 
110. Medical Students’ Religious Liberty: All persons have the liberty of conscience and shall be 
protected under Texas law if they conscientiously object to participating in practices that conflict with 
their moral or religious beliefs. This includes, but is not limited to, abortion, including any requirement 
for a medical resident or physician to perform an elective abortion on an opt-out basis instead of an opt-
in basis, the prescription for and dispensing of drugs with abortifacient potential, human cloning, IVF, 
medical contraception, embryonic stem cell research, eugenic screenings, genetic engineering, 
euthanasia, assisted suicide, harmful futile procedures, vaccines, and the withdrawal of nutrition and 
hydration. 
Any state agency, educational institution, or local entity in Texas which desires to send its employees, 
students, or their representatives out of state to conduct an activity that is illegal in Texas must first 
submit a request and obtain approval from the office of the Attorney General of the State of Texas using 
a form developed and approved by the Attorney General’s office. The form shall be used to assist in the 
determination of whether an activity is legal, and must provide the full identification of the sources, 
addresses, and amounts of the funding by the individual or entity. 
Health and Human Services 
Parents’ Rights 
111. Parental Rights and Responsibilities: We support the fundamental God-given right and 
responsibility of parents to direct and guide their children’s care and moral upbringing. Therefore, we 
Table of Contents 
21
support the constitutional rights of parents to raise and educate their children, including their rights to 
direct the care, custody, control, upbringing, moral and religious training, and medical care of their 
children. Local, state, or federal laws, regulations, or policies that limit parental rights in the rearing of 
both biological and adopted children shall not be enacted.  
112. Parental Rights of Dependent Adult Children: As long as parents are responsible for an adult 
child, through college or the age of 26 when children are on the parents’ insurance, the parents must 
have access to medical information, grades, and other information normally afforded to parents of 
minor children.  
113. Parental Consent: We insist on informed parental consent for all medical care, counseling, etc., for 
all minors.  
Healthcare Independence 
114. Medical Freedom: We call for an addition to the Texas Bill of Rights that explicitly states that 
Texans have the natural, inalienable right to refuse vaccination or other medical treatment. Our 
personal healthcare decisions are private, and informed consent is a basic human right. Therefore, the 
following are expressly forbidden even in an emergency or in a pandemic: 
a) Any attempt to mandate, force, or coerce any medical test, procedure, blood, or product, 
including vaccines or masks.  
b) Any attempt to use a citizen’s vaccination status as a condition to maintain or obtain housing 
or employment or employee benefits, attend school or childcare, or access state services. 
c) The denial of any public service or benefit based on vaccination status.  
d) Any mandates by public, private, government, or medical entities for treatment, vaccination, 
vaccine passports, mask requirements, or health insurance surcharges. 
e) Any involuntary isolation or quarantine of anyone not experiencing an active contagious 
infection. 
f) Any withholding of the risks and benefits of a proposed intervention, including quantifiable 
adverse effects, that must be equally communicated and accessible to the patient or to a minor 
patient’s parents or guardian. 
g) Any prevention of visitation to the ill when risks are acknowledged and mitigated according to 
patient and visitor choice. 
h) Any Nuremberg Code violations, including but not limited to the requirement that 
experimental-use medications, vaccines, or other treatments must provide full knowledgeable 
consent and be free from any form of coercion or inducement.  
i) Any tracing of individuals by cell phones or another means for any reason without an 
individual court-issued warrant.  
j) Any requirement that a nurse practitioner can only provide healthcare to Texans under a 
delegation agreement with a physician in the State of Texas.  
k) Any holding of an individual against their will (or that of their parent or guardian) in a 
hospital or residential care facility, or preventing an individual from changing their healthcare 
provider.  
l) Any jeopardization of the statutorily protected right of Texans to utilize the Texas Exemption 
from Immunizations for Reasons of Conscience Affidavit without scrutiny or adverse action. 
m) Any denial of directed or autologous blood donation. 
115. Texas Medical Practice Act: To protect the rights of both patients and physicians, the Texas 
Medical Board (TMB) should adopt the following provisions in the Texas Medical Practice Act: 
a) Protect the right of patients to choose natural solutions, including chiropractic care, to their 
health problems, as well as the physician’s right to provide natural solutions for health 
problems. 
b) Protect physicians from interference by the TMB or the Texas State Board of Pharmacy in the 
physician’s treatment plans or prescriptions. 
Table of Contents 
22
c) Eliminate confidential complaints against physicians. 
d) Eliminate anonymous medical witnesses against physicians. 
e) Mandate legal due process in all TMB proceedings. 
f) Allow physicians the right to have a complaint against them tried in a state district court, 
rather than in an administrative law court. 
g) Prohibit TMB members from working for insurance, pharmaceutical companies, or hospitals 
while serving on the board, to prevent conflict of interest. 
h) Prohibit intimidation tactics by TMB lawyers against physicians.  
116. Medication Manufacturing: Medications and prescription drugs consumed in the United States 
should be manufactured in the United States for security, consistency, and reliability of the drug. We 
strongly encourage our state to promote private entities to initiate and sustain the buildup of the supply 
chain and manufacturing of the medical and health products in this state to help reduce the costs and 
increase the availability of medical products to its constituents. 
117. Informative Labels on Medications: We require informative labelling on: 
a) All prescription and over-the-counter drugs, supplements, and medical supplies. In addition, 
these medical products must be required to show the country of manufacturing or production.  
b) All medications and vaccines which contain mRNA or aborted fetal material. 
c) All medications, therapeutics, and vaccines which have not completed human trial studies. 
These should be considered to be experimental and potentially harmful, and may not be 
therapeutic. 
118. Secure Medical Records and Informed Consent: We oppose any state or federal medical record 
computer databases that store personal identifiable records on citizens without their written consent. All 
medical service providers, including insurance providers, must implement and maintain a high-level 
technology security safeguard for consumers and patients to prevent financial losses and life-
threatening delays in treatments due to breaches in one or more databases, third-party communications, 
or simultaneous hacks causing egregious delays and financial hardship to doctors and clinics. 
119. Right to Try: We urge the Texas Legislature and Governor to enact laws that protect patients’ (or 
parents’ if the patient is a minor) and their doctors’ rights to have access to experimental or off-label 
medications and procedures that can potentially be lifesaving or improve quality of life, consistent with 
the RPT Platform, without the interference of the Medical Board, Pharmacy Board, or hospital boards.  
120. Healthcare Savings Accounts: All individuals shall be allowed to establish health savings 
accounts. Individuals shall be allowed higher annual contributions to health savings accounts.  
121. Texas HSA: We recommend the creation of the State of Texas Health Savings Account, with funds 
in excess of those needed in the Economic Stabilization Fund (Rainy Day Fund) set aside for the 
purpose of enabling the state to develop reserves sufficient to exit the federal Medicaid program. Funds 
in this Texas HSA shall not expire nor be utilized for any other purpose.  
Government-funded Health Programs 
122. Parental Safeguard: We support abolishing the Texas Child Mental Health Care Consortium, the 
trauma-informed care policy, school-based mental health providers, school-based or school-connected 
mental health interventions, and any other public school programs that serve to expand access to 
minors. Legislators shall prohibit all reproductive healthcare services in public schools.  
123. Welfare Reform: We support the abolition of all federal welfare programs, as they are not an 
appropriate role of the federal government. Until such time, welfare reform should encourage 
partnerships with (without providing any taxpayer funding to) faith-based institutions, community, and 
business organizations to temporarily assist individuals in need. We encourage welfare reform in the 
following areas: 
a) Denying benefits to individuals who cannot prove citizenship. 
b) Reforming welfare programs to require recipients to work, learn, and train to move toward 
self-sufficiency.  
Table of Contents 
23
c) Reforming welfare programs to require recipients to remain substance abuse free and willing 
to submit to and pass random drug testing. 
d) Requiring that money provided through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program 
(SNAP) be used only for nutritious foods consistent with those included under the WIC 
program, and be released only with a photo ID of the approved user. 
e) Implementing a non-monetary-based assistance program for providing supplemental food 
benefits. 
f) Removing prisoners from welfare rolls.  
124. Child Support Related to Welfare: Mothers applying for government financial support, exempting 
rape victims, shall provide the verifiable name and any known contact information of the birth father, 
which information shall be turned over to the State of Texas Attorney General’s Office within 30 days 
for collection of child support.  
125. Oversight of Disability Claims: We call for stronger and more stringent reviews of disability 
claims to ensure that assistance is provided only to those truly in need.  
126. Medicaid Reform: Until we establish the Texas HSA in order to eliminate reliance on federal 
Medicaid, we support Medicaid block grants to the states and returning Medicaid to its original purpose 
to be a temporary assistance program for US citizens. We oppose any further expansion of Medicaid 
and stand in opposition to Medicaid for non-citizens. Medicaid funds shall only be used for genuine 
biological medical ailments. Medicaid 1115 Waiver allocations must be not be used to pay for the 
chemical sterilization of teenage girls or to cause abortions, and the funds must be redirected to genuine 
biological medical needs that will truly improve the lives of young women and authentically contribute 
to good preconception care, good birth outcomes, and good maternal health in Texas. 
127. Medicare Reform: Medicare should be provided only for United States citizens and legal residents 
and there should be a non-penalized opt-out for those who have health insurance through their 
employers and continue to work.  
128. Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (“Obamacare”): We demand the immediate repeal of 
the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which we believe to be unconstitutional.  
129. Home and Community-Based Services: In order to avoid costly institutional care and preserve 
families, we call on the Texas Legislature to enact policies that would support invest in and fully fund 
home and community-based services (HCBS) as a pro-life policy, and to enact associated policy 
solutions to protect, preserve, and defend the sanctity and dignity of human life. We urge the 
Legislature to address any loopholes that fail to protect or provide appropriate home and community-
based supports and access to care for children and people with disabilities. In addition, we ask that 
families be provided with information about life-affirming social and medical services available to 
them in Texas as alternatives to abortion and costly institutional care. 
Mental Health 
130. Caring for Citizens who Are Mentally Disabled: We urge the Legislature to continue funding and 
operating all state-supported living centers for mentally disabled legal Texas residents, and to 
continually seek common sense improvements to increase efficiency. 
131. Mental Health: We oppose all mental, emotional, or well-being surveys, screenings, check-ins, 
assessments, and similar such instruments in public schools and demand that the Texas Legislature ban 
all psychological or mental health questions, instruction, activities, surveys, and check-ins in any 
capacity in public schools. If an employee or contractor of the district has the opinion that a child needs 
to be referred to a mental health professional, he or she shall make such a recommendation to the 
parent or guardian of the child. We implore the Legislature to require informed parental consent prior to 
these and any other psychological questions being presented to a student. The Legislature shall enact 
strict penalties for violation of parental rights regarding school health and mental health services and 
order the strict enforcement of such penalties. 
Table of Contents 
24
Homosexuality and Gender Issues 
132. Homosexuality: Homosexuality is an abnormal lifestyle choice. We believe there should be no 
granting of special legal entitlements or creation of special status for homosexual behavior, regardless 
of state of origin, and we oppose any criminal or civil penalties against those who oppose homosexuality 
out of faith, conviction, or belief in traditional values. No one should be granted special legal status 
based on their LGBTQ+ identification.  
133. Gender Identity: We oppose all efforts to validate transgender identity. We believe gender 
modification and any form of gender affirming care for minors does not constitute medical care and is, 
in fact, child abuse. Further, there shall be no attempt to engage in so-called “gender affirming” 
medical or mental health intervention for persons between the ages of 18 and 26, including: 
a) Intervening in any way to prevent natural progression of puberty. 
b) Administering or providing opposite sex hormones. 
c) Performing any surgery on healthy body parts of that person.  
d) Assigning name and/or pronoun changes. 
Any agency, individual, or other entity promoting, performing, or facilitating gender-transitioning or 
gender-modification of a minor child shall be criminally prosecuted for child abuse and exposed to 
civil actions, enjoying no immunity regardless of profession, relation, or standing. 
134. No Taxpayer Funding for Sex Change: We oppose the use of taxpayer funds for any type of 
medical treatments or interventions intended to alter sex characteristics. This includes but is not limited 
to military personnel and inmates in federal, state, or local prisons or jails. No federal, state, insurance, 
or probate monies may be allocated for the use of such treatment.  
135. Counseling Methods: Therapists, psychologists, and counselors practicing in the State of Texas 
shall not be forbidden or penalized by any licensing board for practicing authentic reparative therapy or 
other counseling methods when counseling clients of any age with identity disorder or unwanted same-
sex attraction.  
Substance Abuse and Addiction 
136. Addiction: We oppose legalization and decriminalization of illicit natural or illegal synthetic 
drugs, and we support the exercise of a zero-tolerance policy with maximum penalty for manufacturers 
and distributors of illegal drugs or their precursors. We also oppose any needle exchange programs or 
supervised drug consumption sites. Faith-based rehabilitation programs shall be considered a part of an 
overall rehabilitation program. 
137. Cannabis Classification: The State of Texas shall retain cannabis as a Schedule I drug. 
Life-Affirming Health Care Concepts 
138. Pornography Crisis: The State of Texas shall recognize that pornography and pedophilia are 
public health hazards. We call on legislators to: 
a) Expand protective measures to block incidental or unwanted exposure to inappropriate 
pornographic material by viewers or users. Violators shall be subject to civil and/or criminal 
penalties.  
b) Pass a complete ban on production and public display of pornography within the state. We 
support restricting the access by minors to internet websites and social media platforms that 
contain or promote any sexually explicit material. We oppose website regulations that specify 
fractional judgments regarding content.  
c)  Prohibit the possession, sale, and distribution of “child-like sex dolls,” which are obscene 
anatomically correct dolls, mannequins, or robots that are used for sexual stimulation or 
gratification and that have the features of or have features that resemble those of minors.  
d)  Prohibit the advertising, promotion, distribution, and sale of obscene devices to minors or 
displayed within minor’s reach. 
Table of Contents

139. Conscience Clause: All persons and legal entities have the right of conscience and shall be 
protected under Texas law if they conscientiously object to participate in practices that conflict with 
their moral or religious beliefs. This includes, but is not limited to, abortion, the prescription for and 
dispensing of drugs with abortifacient potential, human cloning, embryonic stem cell research, eugenic 
screenings, genetic engineering, euthanasia, assisted suicide, harmful futile procedures, vaccines, and 
the withdrawal of nutrition and hydration. We call on the Texas Legislature to enact additional 
conscience protections for all healthcare professionals, including medical students, that are all-
encompassing, enforceable at the state level, and protect against adverse action and retaliation taken 
against an individual.  
140. Fetal Tissue Harvesting and Stem Cell Research: We support legislation prohibiting and 
criminalizing the harvesting, sale, and experimentation, or commercial use of human fetal tissue, 
including those intended for use in vaccines, which requires or is dependent upon the destruction of 
human life. We encourage adult stem cell research using cells from umbilical cords, adults, and any 
other means that does not kill human embryos. We also support elimination of public funding for 
embryonic stem cell research, research on fetal tissue, or human cloning. All products that use 
embryonic and fetal tissue in their production shall be labeled in the State of Texas to inform 
consumers, promote alternatives, and affirm the value of human life.  
141. Support for the Sanctity of Life: The Republican Party of Texas supports programs that provide 
assistance to pregnant women and promote the sanctity of life. 
142. Preventing Any Death by Abortion: We support legislation such as the Preborn Non-
Discrimination Act (pre-NDA) to close existing discriminatory loopholes that fail to protect preborn 
children suspected of having “fetal anomalies” or disabilities, and we support legislation to enact anti-
discriminatory language to apply additional protections to preborn children at risk of being aborted 
because of their sex, race, disability, or age of gestation. Such legislation should provide families with 
information about life-affirming social and medical services available to them in Texas, such as 
perinatal palliative care. We support protecting preborn children and their mothers by stopping abortion 
pill distributors from sending and trafficking these lethal and illegal drugs into Texas and holding those 
accountable who break state Pro-Life laws by selling and trafficking illegal abortion pills. 
143. Medical Emergencies within Pro-Life Laws: We support the current medical emergency exception 
laws which include the management of confirmed ectopic pregnancies, which are not to be considered 
abortions. We do not support inaccurate arguments against abortion which occur due to false and 
misleading rhetoric. The abortion law does not need to be altered, but implementation does need to be 
addressed. We urge the Legislature and health agencies to educate and inform medical professionals 
and the public about the law of medical emergency exceptions. The mother’s life remains the primary 
consideration in providing emergency care exceptions in the management of ectopic pregnancies and 
complicated preterm premature rupture of the membrane (PPROM). 
144. Planned Parenthood: We support completely eliminating public funding for, or contracts with, 
Planned Parenthood, other abortion providers, or any of their affiliates. We oppose their digital or 
physical presence in our schools and other public institutions, and the expansion of their facilities in 
our neighborhoods. We call for a state law prohibiting governmental contracts with abortion providers 
and their affiliates.  
145. Preserving the Dignity of Human Embryos: We support continued efforts to preserve the inherent 
dignity of human embryos, including adoption of human embryos and the banning of human embryo 
trafficking.  
146. Life-Affirming Patient Protection: We call for the Texas Legislature to secure due process and the 
right for vulnerable Texas patients by continuing to reform Chapter 166 of the Health and Safety Code 
(Texas Advance Directives Act) by: 
Table of Contents 
26
a) Repealing the unethical, unconstitutional, unprecedented, and anti-life 25-Day Rule in Section 
166.046, Health and Safety Code, and replacing it with a truly life-affirming law that requires 
physicians to adhere to a patient’s or surrogate’s medical decision about life-sustaining 
treatment, and that provides for physicians who disagree with the patient’s decision to transfer 
the patient to another physician or facility that will honor the decision to continue life-
sustaining treatment. 
b) Improving language that protects Texas patients with disabilities to clarify and strengthen that 
disability should not be a considered factor. 
c) Guaranteeing judicial review, ensuring the ability to appeal a hospital committee’s decision 
and provide impartial legal recourse. 
Environmental Health 
147. Toxic Exposure: We support the immediate implementation of the Toxic Exposure Research Act 
of 2016, which will ensure that the federal government will establish a database on all exposed veterans 
and their families and descendants. The State of Texas shall prohibit the addition of sodium fluoride or 
any other chemicals deemed dangerous, carcinogenic, harmful, or poisonous to community water 
systems.  
148. Less Tech for Little Texans: Any government agency with responsibility for children under ten 
years of age must limit screen time to thirty minutes for every six-hour span on one-to-one devices and 
VR headsets. Children ages ten to fourteen must be limited to two hours per day. Many medical 
research studies have shown significant health adverse reactions to EMF emissions and abnormal 
behavior disorders. 
149. Prohibition of Biocultured Food: The Republican Party of Texas supports the prohibition or 
manufacture, sale, or distribution of food products made from cultured animal cells, bioengineered, or 
mesenchymal cell lines.  
Criminal and Civil Justice 
Rights and Protections 
150. Obscenity Exemption: We urge the Texas Legislature to repeal all laws based on the fraudulent 
research by Dr. Alfred Kinsey, repeal the Texas Penal Code affirmative defenses in the Harmful 
Material to Minor’s Statue and sexual performance of a child. Texas should modify the Miller Test to 
close the loopholes exploited by publishers and digital resources and prohibit taxpayer funding to any 
entity that permits the presentation or encouragement of sexuality, pornography, or transgender 
ideology to minor children.   
151. Civil Asset Forfeiture: We call upon the Texas Legislature to abolish civil asset forfeiture, 
independently or in partnership with federal authorities, and to ensure that private property only be 
forfeited upon a criminal conviction. 
152. Government Surveillance: We oppose all forms of warrantless government surveillance of United 
States citizens and businesses. 
153. Location and Data Privacy: We call upon the Texas Legislature to protect citizens’ current and 
historic technologically available location data by requiring a warrant based on probable cause or a 
legally obtained subpoena. 
154. Hate Crimes: We urge the complete repeal of the hate crime laws, since ample laws are currently 
in effect to punish criminal behavior towards other persons. 
155. Marriage Officiation: We believe religious institutions have the freedom to recognize and perform 
only those marriages that are consistent with their doctrine. 
Table of Contents 
27
156. Warrant Validity: The filers of search warrants shall be held responsible for the validity of the 
information used to obtain the warrants. 
157. State of Emergency and Pandemic Business Fines: We support prohibiting fines or imprisonment 
of business owners for operating their business during a state of emergency or during pandemics, and 
we call for the Legislature to pass these protections into law. 
158. Fraudulent Lien Filings: We support legislation designed to reduce fraud by requiring that the 
identity of the debtor on all liens be confirmed prior to filing by at least three methods, including but 
not necessarily limited to state ID, county records, and personal contact. 
159. Gain-of-Function Accountability: We call for the banning of gain-of-function research in Texas. 
We support investigations and indictments of those who participate in funding, developing, 
introducing, or releasing gain-of-function pathogens. We call on a ban of mRNA technology for 
vaccines in humans, animals, and food. We urge the Legislature to authorize the Attorney General and 
appropriate law enforcement agencies to investigate and prosecute for treason and murder any and all 
participants who knowingly release biological weapons or vaccines that cause harm. 
Courts, Prosecutions, Restitution 
160. Penalty For False or Illegal Accusation of Impeachment: If someone brings articles of 
impeachment and the charges are found to be false, then the accusers shall be held personally liable for 
legal fees and past wages which shall be reimbursed from the accusers’ personal funds to the defendant. 
161. Court Accountability: We support the right to inform the jurors of their common law power to 
judge law (jury nullification) as well as the evidence, and to vote on the verdict according to their 
conscience. We believe district attorneys have a duty to seek justice for victims of all forms of crime 
and oppose policies that systematically decline to prosecute crimes. All judges shall be required to state 
their final decisions on record, immediately validating and producing a mandatory Finding of Facts and 
Conclusions of Law for every substantive decision or final ruling in a case, and preserving the 
complete record in all transactions in court and in chambers, including audio and video. We support 
providing the Texas Attorney General a process to investigate and remove district attorneys that fail to 
enforce Texas law. Texas judges, attorneys, and court actors in Texas will no longer have any immunity 
when violating the law. Strong penalties should be implemented for elected officials found reducing 
criminal cases to skew records. We urge the Texas Legislature to enact legislation to hold judges and 
prosecutors accountable for violating their oaths of office or the laws of the State of Texas and to end 
any explicit or implicit judicial or prosecutorial immunity for their actions. 
162. Frivolous Lawsuits: We support further reform to discourage frivolous lawsuits. We oppose the 
abusive use of class action lawsuits and any law that allows government agencies to collect lawyer fees 
from the plaintiff when they win, but not have to pay the plaintiff fees when they lose. We call for the 
legislature to keep the Texas Citizens Participation Act and essential protections for Texans’ 1st 
Amendment rights. 
163. Bail Reform: We call upon the Texas Legislature to ensure bail in Texas is based only on a 
person’s danger to society, risk of flight, and criminal history. District attorneys and judges will stop 
setting bails that are egregiously low for the nature of the crime or release violent offenders into the 
community. If said offender commits a violent crime while out on bail, and bail or release was not 
granted based on the merits of the alleged violent crime, the district attorney and judge involved in the 
case are not exempt from penalties or civil suits for enabling offenders. Personal Recognizance (PR) 
Bonds should only be allowed for first time, non-violent offenders. 
164. Human Trafficking and Jurisdiction: We call upon the Texas Legislature to amend the Code of 
Criminal Procedure to allow victims of human trafficking to have convictions within the previous ten 
years for prostitution offenses set aside if the victims received these convictions as a direct result of 
being trafficked. The Texas Legislature shall pass legislation granting the Texas Attorney General full 
concurrent jurisdiction over multi-jurisdictional cases, to be limited specifically to those cases 
involving human trafficking.  
165. Rule of Law Enforcement: We support rule of law and enforcement of laws, which maintain an 
ordered republic. We call for independent prosecutorial authority to prosecute crimes that maintain 
Table of Contents 
28
order (such as sedition, riot, official oppression, election integrity, etc.) to be delegated to a statewide 
officer such as the Attorney General. We call on the Legislature to ensure that election crimes will be 
promptly prosecuted, even in counties with progressive district attorneys. 
Law Enforcement 
166. Abortion Homicide Exemption: The physician homicide exemption of the Texas Penal Code 
Section 19.06 should be modified to apply only to non-elective abortions such as required to save the 
life of the mother. 
167. Capital Punishment: Properly applied capital punishment is legitimate and should be reasonably 
swift, while respecting all due process. 
168. Police, Firefighters, and Other First Responders: We support proper funding for robust training 
programs that provide first responders with intensive and comprehensive physical and academic 
training in the classroom and on the ground. We ask that the Texas Legislature properly fund 
preventative and responsive mental health care for the same. We recommend the Legislature increase 
funding for the Texas Rural Volunteer Fire Department Assistance Program. 
169. No-Knock Raids: We call upon the Texas Legislature to improve no-knock warrant procedures to 
protect law enforcement and the community. 
170. Political Policing: We believe that laws should be enforced uniformly, that punishment should 
meet the crime, and that law enforcement should never be used to target individuals for political 
purposes. We oppose the targeting of police officers by progressive district attorneys. We support 
automatic and prompt expunction of law enforcement officials’ records who are found not guilty in a 
court of law for job-related actions. The district attorney shall provide a letter of denial to prosecute 
within thirty (30) days. 
Family Law 
171. Equal Parenting: We support legislation providing for equal and consistent parenting (possession 
and access) for every child, when both parents, one biological man and one biological woman, are fit, 
willing, and able, as is in the best interest of the child. 
172. Child Protective Services: We support reforming or replacing Child Protective Services, and we 
ask for legislation that would support due process in family court proceedings, oversight of the system, 
and, if requested by either party, a jury determining the outcome of any case. The Texas Department of 
Family and Protective Services or any agency, company, or occupation charged with protecting abused 
or neglected children and its employees will not enjoy any immunity when violating state, local, or 
federal laws, guidelines, or constitutional rights and protections. 
173. Protect Our Children: We support increasing the minimum sentencing for sexual assault on a 
minor (less than 14 years old) to 25 years and removing the option for parole for such offenders. We 
support: 
a) Notifying the victim or victim representative sixty (60) days in advance of any changes to 
scheduled court proceeding, filing, or continuances. 
b) Amending Texas Code of Procedures Article 56A.452 to comport with this plank.  
State Affairs 
Heritage Preservation  
174. Alamo: The Alamo should be remembered and not “reimagined.” Texas’ authority over the Alamo 
shall not be infringed by any organization, including local governments, the federal government, the 
United Nations, or UNESCO. Decision-making authority must remain with Texas, and custodians must 
affirm the significance of the 1836 battle, maintain transparency, and protect all existing monuments, 
Table of Contents 
29
especially the Cenotaph, which shall not be moved. Plaza and Plaza de Valero, the areas located in front 
of the Alamo Church, shall be dedicated to the public use as an open space. 
175. Heritage: We call on governmental entities to protect all symbols of our American and Texan 
heritage. This includes opposing the removal of the Ten Commandments and other religious symbols, 
supporting the Pledge Protection Act, establishing penalties for flag desecration, preserving Texas 
history and sites, and restoring plaques honoring the Confederate widows’ pension fund. We support 
March 2nd Texas Independence Day being an official state holiday. We support having all schools, state 
agencies, and public offices celebrate and honor Constitution Day on September 17th of each year or 
the preceding Friday or following Monday closest thereto.  
176. Historical Monuments: We believe that all Texas historical war memorials, including Confederate 
monuments, shall be protected from future removal or defacement, and we believe that those 
monuments that have been removed should be restored to their historical locations. We support the 
continuing allocation of funds that are necessary to preserve the USS Texas as a permanent monument 
to the ship, her crew of two world wars, and the history of the State of Texas. 
177. Military Base Names: Publicly honor the southern heroes and rescind all name changes of our 
military bases. 
178. Honor Our Flags: We appreciate and honor our flags and what they represent, and we strongly 
advocate for all public schools to display only the United States and Texas flags in every classroom and 
to begin each school day with the pledges to both. We call for the requirement of raising American and 
Texas flags on publicly-funded student campuses and the prohibition of other flags (other than United 
States military flags) to be hung on publicly funded buildings on student campuses. All Texas students 
attending publicly funded campuses will see American and Texas flags throughout university 
campuses. 
Individual Rights and Freedoms  
179. Identity Theft and Data Privacy: The Texas Legislature shall expand existing privacy laws, and 
laws protecting against identity theft by limiting the ways in which internet providers, schools, federal 
and state government entities, and others may access, collect, store, and use Texans’ electronic 
communications, documents, metadata, and protected information.  
180. Religious Freedom for Business: We support the removal of laws and regulations that are used to 
force business owners and employees to violate their conscience, sincerely held beliefs, or core values. 
Properly defining public accommodation as understood in the Civil Rights Act of 1964 requires that 
we:  
a) Prohibit any change to the legal definition by any federal, state, or local law to expand 
government control to restrict any 1st Amendment rights.  
b) Proscribe any law that requires any private business or individual to create or provide a 
custom product or service, any kind of expressive work, enter into a contract, or be coerced 
into any speech that is not their own. 
c) Prohibit businesses from professing, espousing, or adopting any views on sex, sexuality, 
gender, or gender identity, other than to guarantee that views and positions on these matters 
are not used as a basis for denial of access to available public accommodations.  
181. Freedom of Speech and Religious Practice: As America is “one nation under God,” founded on 
Judeo-Christian principles, we affirm the constitutional right of all individuals to worship as they 
choose. We strongly believe in Religious Freedom and Freedom of Speech. Therefore, we demand:  
a) The repeal of the Johnson Amendment, which assaults the free speech of pastors and religious 
organizations.  
b) Protection of the 1st Amendment rights of any citizen to practice their religion and exercise 
their right to free speech in the public square, as well as in religious organization affiliations.  
Table of Contents 
30
c) Texas judges and legislators uphold and defend our God-given unalienable rights of religious 
liberty and freedom of speech to protect against the intimidation and prevention of Christians 
and other people of faith from exercising these rights.  
d) Acknowledgment that the Church is a God-ordained institution with a sphere of authority 
separate from that of civil government, and thus the Church is not to be regulated, controlled, 
or taxed by any level of civil government. Nor shall services or other church functions ever 
again be shut down or suspended by overreaching civil authorities under any pretext 
whatsoever.  
e) Texas Legislation adopt language to oppose abuse of emergency powers to seize or block bank 
accounts or to criminalize political speech as a result of protected speech under the 1st 
Amendment. 
182. Gender Identity and Government Policy: We support legislation in the State of Texas that ensures:  
a) That all public and private restrooms, changing facilities, showers, etc., be segregated based 
on biological sex.   
b) Opposition to any attempt to criminalize or penalize anyone for the wrong use of pronouns.  
c) All government agencies guarantee that views and positions on these matters are not used as a 
basis to deny access to public accommodations, as defined by the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 
nor to deny employment, or discriminate in employment decisions, solely on the basis of a 
person’s views on these matters.  
d) Mandating adherence to sex identification on all official documents that is in alignment with 
biological sex. Male is defined as the sex having the capacity to produce small gametes; 
female is defined as having the capacity to produce large gametes.  
Family and Gender Issues  
183. Human Sexuality: We affirm God’s biblical design for marriage and family between one 
biological man and one biological woman, which has proven to be the foundation for all great nations 
in Western Civilization. We oppose homosexual marriage, regardless of state of origin. We urge the 
Texas Legislature to pass religious liberty protections for individuals, businesses, and government 
officials who believe marriage is between one man and one woman. We oppose the granting of special 
legal entitlements or creation of special status for sexual behavior or identity, regardless of state of 
origin. We oppose any criminal or civil penalties against those who oppose non-traditional sexual 
behavior out of faith, conviction, or belief in traditional values.  
184. Protect Minors Until Age of Consent: A law shall be enacted to protect the rights of the individual 
until the age of consent is reached, to include:  
a) Prohibiting social transitioning or other treatments.  
b) Protecting against predatory sexual behaviors including, but not limited to, public “Drag 
Queen Story Hour“ sessions. 
c) Prohibiting the desensitization of children to sexual topics by inappropriately exposing them 
to, or normalizing of, sexual behavior.  
d) Requiring the disclosure of the above offenses to parents or guardians.  
185. Definition of Marriage and Family: We support the definition of marriage as a God-ordained, 
legal, and moral covenant only between one biological man and one biological woman. Further, we 
support a traditional definition of family with only one biological man in the role of father and one 
biological woman in the role of mother. We are opposed to same-sex parenting, intentionally subjecting 
a child to the loss of their biological father or mother, and other non-traditional definitions of family.  
186. State Authority Over Marriage: We support withholding jurisdiction from the federal courts and 
nullifying federal Executive Branch rules, orders, regulations, or licensing requirements in cases 
involving family law, and especially any changes in the definition of marriage. 
187. Nullify Unconstitutional Ruling: We believe the Obergefell v. Hodges decision, overturning the 
Texas law prohibiting same-sex marriage in Texas, has no basis in the Constitution and should be 
nullified.  
Table of Contents 
31
188. Spousal Benefits: We shall not recognize or grant to any unmarried person the legal rights or 
status of a spouse, as defined in Principle number 6 of this Platform, including granting benefits by 
political subdivisions.  
189. No-Fault Divorce: The Texas Family Code shall be completely rewritten with regards to No-Fault 
Divorce and Child Custody. Suits related to these topics shall be delineated in such a way as to remove 
the need for any but the most minimal judicial interaction, and promote the maintenance of the 
traditional family via required intervention or counseling prior to any decree of divorce. We urge the 
Legislature to rescind unilateral no-fault divorce laws, to support covenant marriage, and to pass 
legislation extending the period of time in which a divorce may occur to six months after the date of 
filing for divorce.  
190. Adoption: We encourage the Texas Legislature to remove as many barriers to adoption as possible 
and to make the process less intrusive while protecting children’s safety and best interests. We urge the 
Texas Legislature to adopt the following steps to promote adoption:  
a) Expand community-based care: Increase partnerships with local private and nonprofit 
charitable organizations to create a safer and more responsive system.  
b) Require a guilty verdict before placing individuals in the Central Registry: Currently an 
unsubstantiated accusation of abuse or neglect can lead to Texans’ being listed in a 
government database and cause them to lose jobs and suffer other penalties without ever being 
found guilty by a court. In some cases, even those found innocent remain listed on the 
database. No Texan shall be deprived of liberty or their right to earn a living without a fair 
hearing.  
c) Expand service options: Improve care for families of children at risk of entering foster care by 
providing more choice and flexibility for family preservation services outside of the current 
state-contracted services.  
d) End hidden foster care: Many families are threatened and coerced into giving up custody of 
their children without ever going to court. Texas shall protect parents’ rights and end coercive 
agreements by limiting CPS’s ability to separate families without court oversight.  
e) Repeal anonymous reporting: False reporting of families to CPS can lead to great harm and a 
large waste of resources. False reporting can be prevented while increasing the accuracy of 
reports to CPS by eliminating the option of anonymous reporting in favor of confidentiality. 
Professionals who must report suspicious activity shall be trained on alternatives to filing a 
CPS report and permitted to refer struggling families to community service providers. 
f) Make the adoption process more affordable, streamlined, and accessible. 
g) Provide more support to adoptive children and biological and adoptive families, such as access 
to affordable mental health care. 
h) Work to destigmatize adoption for both birth mothers and potential adoptive families. 
i) Increase funding to foster care background checks and wellness checks, including 
interviewing children in foster care.  
We urge communities and people of faith to promote adoption and, for those not called to adopt, to 
offer assistance to families that can. We believe that, in the best interests of the family and child, the 
State of Texas should allow children to be adopted only by married or single heterosexuals.  
191. Child Rights: We call on the Texas Legislature to pass legislation to protect privacy in public 
schools and government buildings by ensuring that multi-use facilities, including showers, changing 
rooms, and bathrooms, are designated for and used only by persons based on the person’s biological 
sex.  
192. Detransitioners: We support detransitioners and desisters in their pursuit of establishing a healthy 
lifestyle after being harmed by the gender identity industry, including: 
a) The extension of statute of limitations for medical malpractice suits from two years to ten 
years, or until the individual is 26 years old, whichever is longer, for persons who underwent 
social or medical “transition” as minors and have suffered mental or physical damage as a 
result. 
Table of Contents 
32
b) Requiring health insurance companies that fund social or medical “transition” procedures or 
therapy to also fully fund the expenses incurred due to deleterious side effects and treatment 
necessary to detransition or desist safely. 
193. Keep Prisons and Jails Single Sex: The Texas Legislature should mandate that juveniles and adults 
detained in jails, detention centers, or prisons be housed according to biological sex. Any search of an 
inmate or detainee which involves physical contact must be performed by an officer whose biological 
sex matches the biological sex of the inmate or detainee. 
Pro-Life Issues  
194. Pro-Life: Abortion is not healthcare, it is homicide. Until the abolition of abortion is achieved, we 
support laws that restrict and regulate abortion, including but not limited to:  
a) Parental and informed consent, including the elimination of judicial bypass.  
b) Prohibition of licensing, liability, and malpractice insurance for abortionists and abortion 
facilities.  
c) Prohibition of financial kickbacks for abortion referrals.  
d) Prohibition of late-term abortions.  
e) Prohibition of abortions after the time an unborn child’s heartbeat is detected.  
f) Prohibition of the manufacturing, importation, sale, dispensing and use of abortifacients. The 
state may enforce criminal penalties, while private individuals may enforce civil penalties 
against companies and suppliers of online sales and delivery of any form of abortifacients. 
g) Elimination of causes of action for “wrongful birth.”  
h) Health insurance coverage for abortion services and abortifacients, which under Texas law 
shall be considered supplemental coverage and billed to the beneficiary.  
i) Criminal penalties be attached to any entity convicted of selling body parts of aborted children 
or, excluding the mother, of conducting an illegal abortion.  
j) Extending the private cause of action used in the Texas Heartbeat Act to all pro-life laws and 
policies in Texas. 
k) A Legislative study on the effects of abortion numbers post-Roe, and to discuss a better 
solution than the current failing legislation in effect. 
l) Supporting the right of Texas municipalities to protect mothers and their preborn children in 
their communities by passing enforceable city ordinances that further ban abortions within 
their city limits, closing loopholes in state abortion laws. 
195. Abolish Abortion: We urge the Texas Legislature to enact legislation to abolish abortion by 
immediately securing the right to life and equal protection of the laws to all preborn children from the 
moment of fertilization and to oppose legislation that discriminates against any preborn children and 
violates the United States Constitution by denying such persons equal protection of the laws, and to 
adopt effective tools to ensure the enforcement of our laws to protect life when doctors or district 
attorneys fail to do so. 
196. Inviolability of Life and Fundamental Right to Life: All innocent human life must be respected 
and safeguarded from fertilization to natural death. Therefore, the unborn, the aged, and the physically 
or mentally challenged have a fundamental individual right to life which cannot be infringed. We 
respect the uniqueness of human life and oppose practices that corrupt human DNA, mix human and 
animal DNA, or other transhumanist initiatives that do not respect the sanctity and uniqueness of 
human life. All humans are endowed by their Creator with sovereign rights of ownership of their 
person and DNA, regardless of any DNA modification, and claims to the contrary are invalid.  
Land Use  
197. Property Annexation and De-Annexation: Homeowners and landowners in an area proposed for 
annexation shall have the right to vote to approve or reject the annexation, including infill development 
zones (IDZ), regardless of the population of the county. No annexation can occur within 45 days of any 
Table of Contents

election. In any city with a population of over 250,000, any neighborhood can elect to de-annex and 
reincorporate as a new city – for any reason – provided they receive at least 50% plus one vote of those 
voting in a regular election and living within the defined de-annexation boundaries. 
198. HOA Governance: We support legislation restricting the power of HOAs: 
a) Informed consent: buyers must sign stating they read every page of the document, from page 
one to the end of the document. 
b) No authority to foreclose. 
c) No authority to restrict the flying of the United States flag. 
d) No restrictions on rainwater collection. 
e) No changes to terms without 85% consent of the home owners and property owners. 
f) Developers must turnover HOA once 70% of the original lots or land are purchased. 
g) Be obligated to abide by open meeting rules. 
h) Practice financial transparency. 
i) Only owners who live or own adjacent or within two lots can file complaints. 
j) Abolish any and all extra-judicially enforced policies. 
199. Property Rights: Property ownership and free enterprise, the foundation of our collective wealth, 
must not be abridged or denied by government. We support legislation to protect these bedrock rights. 
Areas of concern are:  
annexation 
eminent domain (including foreign entities) 
property forfeiture 
natural resources and conservation easements 
extraterritorial jurisdiction 
seizure for public or private development 
nationalization of lands 
preservation of our 4th Amendment right to privacy  
groundwater and mineral rights 
 
Property owners shall be notified of their rights regarding condemnation, annexation, or easement, and 
the condemner shall be required to petition a court of jurisdiction to show public necessity. Taking of 
property shall result in immediate compensation of fair market value to the owner. These issues shall be 
administered by elected officials accountable to voters. We strongly encourage amendments to the 
existing Texas laws to further protect the homeowner’s property rights against squatters with minimal 
legal intervention. No state, county, municipality, HOA, or other entity can restrict a landowner or 
renter from harvesting rainwater on their property or the property they rent. 
200. Eminent Domain: The use of eminent domain must exclude the seizure of private property for 
private economic development or increased tax revenue, in addition to compensation for damages and 
the value of the taking, and eminent domain laws should be restructured to include negotiated annual 
payments in perpetuity for the easement across the property that is affected payable from the company 
or corporation acquiring the easement. These provisions should also include toll roads and high-speed 
rail lines. Landowners who prevail in eminent domain cases disputing the taking of their property or 
the property value shall be reimbursed for all attorney’s fees, expert witness fees, appraisal fees, and 
costs.  
201. No Part of Texas to be Owned by Foreign Interests: 
a) The State of Texas shall prohibit the sale of all real estate interests within its borders to all 
except American citizens (defined by current statute) or United States owned and operated 
corporations. The sole exception to this rule is that a lawful immigrant may own one single 
family residential property and/or small business. 
b) All land in Texas that is currently owned by foreign individuals, corporations, or interests with 
ties to such, will be required to sell their property and vacate immediately. Land that is within 
50 miles of a military base, and owned by interests related to all foreign governments, or any 
other foreign state considered hostile to the United States, will be seized immediately under 
Eminent Domain. Our security is not for sale. 
c) Farmland in active agriculture service cannot be purchased and allowed to become inactive. 
The current trend of the rich to purchase land for the purpose of decommissioning it to restrict 
the amount of food available to the public must be stopped. The penalty for this type of 
treason shall include the loss of the property.

34
State Governance  
202. Campaign Contribution Limits: We urge immediate repeal of all limits on campaign contributions 
by American citizens to the candidates or causes of their choice. However, the State of Texas should 
pass legislation for non-federal elections which bans campaign contributions and expenditures that 
originate from outside the State of Texas, including those by individuals, organizations, and political 
action committees, and including those on any questions, propositions, and amendments on any ballots. 
203. Texas Independence: The Texas Legislature should pass a bill in its next session requiring a 
referendum in the next General Election for the people of Texas to determine whether or not the State 
of Texas should reassert its status as an independent nation. This referendum should be a legislative 
priority. 
204. Marijuana Remains Illegal: We oppose the legalization of recreational marijuana and we support 
offering opportunities for drug treatment before penalties for its illegal possession or use.  
205. Gun-Free Zones in Texas: There shall be no gun-free zones in Texas. Any public access property 
owner who demands law-abiding citizens disarm themselves shall assume liability for injuries they 
incur while on the “posted premises.” 
206. Daylight Savings Time: Texas should no longer participate in Daylight Savings Time. 
207. City of Austin Management: We support the revocation of home rule status for the city of Austin, 
and transfer of its management to the State of Texas. 
208. Digital Passport: The Texas Legislature should ban all digital passports and digital identification.  
Government and Election Integrity 
Government Operations 
209. Sexual Harassment: We believe sexual harassment by elected and appointed officials should not 
be tolerated. 
210. Government Authority: We believe any government authority that has the ability to levy a tax or 
fee or to appraise property on the people should be accountable to those who pay the taxes via the 
electoral process, from the local level to the federal level. 
211. Federal Land Disposition: All Federal lands shall be turned over to their respective states, except 
for land specifically authorized in the Constitution (military bases, federal buildings, post offices). 
212. Tax-Funded Lobbying: We oppose using tax dollars to hire lobbyists or paying tax dollars to 
associations that lobby the Legislature, in particular by public schools. 
213. Texas Speaker of the House, House Committees, and Legislative Quorum: In the Texas 
Legislature: 
a) We oppose the use of pledge cards and call for Republican members to caucus after each 
November General Election to determine, by secure secret ballot, their candidate for Speaker 
and Speaker Pro Tempore. We also call for Republican members to vote as a unified body for 
their selected Speaker and Speaker Pro Tempore candidate when the Legislature convenes in 
regular session, provided that the individual selected in caucus for speaker publicly pledges to 
comply with the entirety of this plank. 
b) Texas House standing committees shall advance the conservative grassroots agenda, not those 
of special interests and lobbyists. The chairman and a majority of members of key committees 
shall support the conservative agenda. All committees shall be chaired by Republicans when 
in the majority. 
Table of Contents 
35
c) Any legislator who purposely refuses to attend a legally scheduled session for the purpose of 
denying a quorum shall lose any chairmanship, vice-chairmanship, and committee 
membership to which he/she may have been appointed. The individual shall lose any salary 
for that absence period. Additionally, the individual shall pay back any earnings and cost of 
living allowances earned during that period. 
214. Caucus Priorities: We urge the Texas Senate Republican Caucus and the Texas House Republican 
Caucus to adopt and publish a list of legislative priorities before convening each regular session of the 
legislature. These priorities shall be in line with those of the Republican Party of Texas. 
215. Timely Legislative Action: We call for changes to the House Rules and legislation that will 
improve timely legislative action in the Legislature including: 
a) Legislation to remove the constitutional provision that the Legislature cannot take action until 
sixty (60) days after convening. 
b) Requiring the House Calendars Committee to vote on a bill within fourteen days of receipt, or 
it is automatically put on the calendar. 
c) Automatic setting of a bill on the calendar within seven days if it is cosponsored by a simple 
majority plus one of House members. 
d) Votes on each bill individually that is not set on the calendar, rather than killing a slate of bills 
at once. 
e) Requiring assignment of all bills to a committee within seven days of the filing deadline or 
within two days of receipt from the opposite chamber. 
f) A petition process for legislators to petition the House Speaker to have the ability to move a 
bill out of committee by getting a prescribed number of signatures of the Representatives and 
having the bill sent to the floor with no changes within one week of presenting the petition 
that contains the prescribed number of signatures. 
216. Unelected Bureaucrats: We oppose the appointment of unelected bureaucrats and we support 
defunding and abolishing the following departments or agencies: 
Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) 
Centers for Disease Control (CDC) 
Housing and Urban Development (HUD) 
Commerce 
 
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) 
Education  
Interior (specifically, the Bureau of Land Management) 
Energy 
National Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
Health and Human Services (HHS) 
Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) 
Labor  
The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 
Labor Relations Board 
Transportation Security Administration (TSA) 
The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) 
and any other federal agency or department that is not authorized by the Constitution. In the interim, 
executive decisions by departments or agencies must be reviewed and approved by Congress before 
taking effect.  
We believe the people of Texas should elect their own Secretary of State and Texas Education Agency 
(TEA) Commissioner. 
217. Sunset Commission: We support a majority citizen-led Sunset Commission. 
Elections 
218. Bonds Create Bondage: State and local bond election ballots shall be required to include the 
amount of debt currently outstanding, current debt service payments, current per capita debt 
obligations, the amount of new debt being proposed, estimated debt service for the new debt, and 
estimated per capita burden being proposed. The bond issue must obtain a two-thirds (2/3) affirmative 
vote of at least 20% of registered voters in the voting jurisdiction. No public funds are to be spent 
Table of Contents 
36
influencing a bond election. We oppose bundling of items on bond election ballots and “rolling 
polling“ for bond and tax rate increase elections. Any bond election, at any level of government in 
Texas, must state on the ballot, “This is a tax increase,” in bold print. 
219. Pay-to-Play Endorsement Slates: We oppose “pay-to-play“ endorsement slates where a candidate 
has paid or promised to pay to be included. We oppose the use of the Republican brand and logos by 
private Political Action Committees (PAC) that endorse in the primaries. 
220. In-Person Election Voting: In-person voting shall be conducted as a single period of time of no 
more than three days with no time gap between the first day of voting and Election Day. Election Day 
statutes must be used for the entire voting period. 
221. Fair Elections Procedures: We support the right of eligible voters to cast a ballot in each election 
once, but we oppose illegal voting, illegal assistance, or allowing votes by ineligible persons.  
We support: 
a) Allowing, by open records request, a bit-by-bit forensic imaging of all electronic devices, 
including servers, at Central Counting immediately before and after each election. 
b) Vigorous enforcement of all election laws as written, and we oppose any laws, lawsuits, and 
judicial decisions that make voter fraud very difficult to deter, detect, or prosecute. 
c) Voter Photo ID. 
d) Prohibition of remote electronic and internet voting for public office and any ballot measure. 
e) That mail-in ballots must be requested and only granted to voters who cannot physically 
appear in-person, that the request must utilize the official application form only, and the 
ballots must arrive before 7 p.m. on Election Day (with the exception of APO addresses). 
Mail-in ballots should not be separated from their carrier envelopes until the polls close. 
f) Felony status for willful violations of the Texas Election Code. 
g) The constitutional authority of state legislatures to regulate voting, including disenfranchisement 
of convicted felons and the opposition to the federal takeover of our elections. 
h) Changes to the appropriate sections of Texas law that would deny or cancel a homestead 
exemption, driver license, and License to Carry if the addresses on those documents DO NOT 
match the address on the voter’s registration. 
i) Consolidating elections to Primary, Runoff, Special Called, and General Election days and 
locations.  
j) Sequentially numbered and signed paper ballots that contain anti-counterfeiting measures  and 
are accounted through strong chain of custody procedures. 
k) An amendment to the Texas Constitution to restore authority to the Texas Attorney General to 
prosecute election crimes. 
l) The ability for civil lawsuits to be filed for election fraud or failure of officials to follow the 
Texas Election Code. 
m) Allowing trained poll watchers from anywhere in Texas with local party or candidate 
approval. 
n) Creating processes that will allow rapid adjudication of election law violation disputes as they 
occur and before violations can be successfully perpetrated. 
o) Direct prohibition on all types of preferential or ranked choice voting systems in ALL 
elections to include school board, municipal, county, statewide, and federal elections. 
p) Striking Chapter 43.007 Countywide Polling Place Program in the Texas Election Code and 
requiring PRECINCT ONLY voting for any in-person voting with the using of paper poll 
books only. 
q) The use of precinct-level, county-level, and state-level vote count verification processes and 
statistically based randomized audits. 
r) Expanding write-once data memory cards from Central Counting Stations into precinct-level 
ballot counters (SB 1661, 88th Regular Session). 
Table of Contents 
37
s) Having judges and DPS officers as election marshals that are trained in election law and 
making them available during elections to hear and resolve election-related cases, to include 
candidate eligibility. 
t) Requiring persons who utilize the Reasonable Impediment Declaration to provide their 
thumbprints on the form for purposes of later verification. 
u) Requiring the Texas Election Code to limit the number of voters that a voter assistant can 
assist to no more than three voters per election. This stipulation includes the entire duration of 
the voting period. 
v) Requiring all State and Local Candidates to post a statement of their criminal history 
regarding any class A misdemeanors and felony offenses on their websites while they are 
running for public office.  
222. Voter Registration: We support restoring integrity to the voter registration rolls and reducing voter 
fraud by: 
a) Repealing all motor voter laws. 
b) Requiring voters to re-register if they have not voted in a five-year period. 
c) Requiring photo ID proof of citizenship with the voter registration application for all 
registrants. 
d) Retaining the 30-day registration deadline. 
e) Conducting periodic checks on the voter rolls to ensure all currently registered voters are 
eligible, with penalties for election officials not performing the checks. 
f) Giving the Secretary of State enforcement authority to ensure county registrar compliance 
with Secretary of State directives. 
g) Revising Title 19 funding to avoid incentivizing retention of ineligible voters. 
h) Promoting a collaboration between states to ensure accuracy in Texas voter rolls without an 
interstate cross-check system. 
i) Having all Texas counties integrate into the Texas Secretary of State voter roll platform. No 
Texas county shall use a third party to manage, in any form, that county’s voter roll. 
223. Campaigning at Poll Sites: We condemn the illegal actions of any government entity that does not 
uphold Texas Election Law on free speech at polling sites outside of the existing boundaries. The right 
to campaign, including the display of signage, at an appropriate distance (100 feet) from the polling 
place shall not be infringed. 
224. Voting Rights: We support equal suffrage for all United States citizens of voting age. We oppose 
any identification of citizens by race, race, origin, creed, sexuality, or lifestyle choices, and oppose use 
of any such identification for purposes of creating voting districts. We urge that the Voting Rights Act 
of 1965, codified and updated in 1973, be repealed and not reauthorized. 
225. Closed Primary: We support protecting the integrity of the Republican Primary Election by 
requiring a closed primary system in Texas. While we welcome people to join the Republican Party 
who support limited government and traditional values, we oppose campaigns to get liberal Democrats 
to cross over and move the Republican Party to the left in the Primary. 
226. Redistricting: We support drawing districts based on eligible voters, not pure population. We 
believe districts should be geographically compact when possible. We oppose any redistricting map 
that is unfair to conservative candidates in the Primary or the General Election. 
227. Republican Party Operations: We oppose all legislative actions that limit the Republican Party of 
Texas (RPT), the County Executive Committees (CEC), and subcommittees over the ability to adopt 
bylaws on calling meetings, filling vacancies, or administrating party accounts and contracts. 
Moreover, we support removing the Republican Party of Texas from the Election Code, which allows 
for closed primaries and for making and enforcing its own rules. We support the current framework in 
which the State Republican Executive Committee (SREC) — Chairman, Vice Chairman, and members 
from the Senatorial Districts — are elected by the delegates at the State Convention.

228. Hand-Counting Procedures: We support the rights of counties that are willing and able to 
competently and efficiently implement voting procedures that do not require the use of machines, and 
support implementing hand-counting procedures that are more efficient, verifiable, secure, fully 
auditable, and transparent, with video of each ballot and each counting station, through appropriate 
changes to Chapter 65 of the Texas Election Code. 
National Defense and Foreign Affairs 
Veterans Affairs 
229. Preservation of Military Honor and Integrity: We believe that the honor and integrity of our active 
duty and military veterans must be protected. False accusations of Stolen Valor are harmful and unjust, 
damaging the reputations of those who have honorably served our country. To deter such malicious 
actions, we propose that making false accusations of Stolen Valor be classified as a criminal offense, 
with penalties equivalent to those for defamation. These changes will uphold the respect and dignity 
our military personnel and veterans deserve, ensuring that their sacrifices are honored and safeguarded. 
230. Support of Our Armed Forces: The men and women who wear our country’s uniform, whether on 
active duty or in the Reserves, National Guard, or Texas State Guard, are the most important assets in 
our military arsenal. All current and prior military personnel and their families must have the benefits, 
healthcare, housing, education, and overall support they need. Injured military personnel deserve the 
best medical, mental health, and rehabilitative care our country has to offer. The Texas State Guard 
should receive the funding necessary for equipment, uniforms, healthcare, and pay needed to 
accomplish the mission of the Texas Guard motto, “Texans Serving Texas.” Department of Veteran 
Affairs monetary benefits shall match present national price index value in all programs. We support 
giving veterans true choice in healthcare by granting veterans insurance to see the doctors of their 
choosing, eliminating wait time deaths, suicides, misdiagnoses, and overall negligent healthcare. 
231. Texas National Guard Benefits: The Legislature shall provide parity of benefits to the Texas 
National Guard, regardless of whether it is activated under state or federal orders. Parity would include, 
but not be limited to, the same benefits provided by the Hazlewood Act, and also the same benefits as, 
or equal benefits to, those from the VA that would be provided by federal deployment orders.  
232. Eliminate Illegal Immigration Magnets: The State of Texas shall impose a 100% surcharge on 
remittances from an illegal alien to a recipient in a foreign nation. The state shall refuse to grant a birth 
certificate to any child born to illegal alien parents on Texas soil, shall require proof of legal residency 
for obtaining a Texas driver’s license or for enrolling in public school, and shall require proof of 
citizenship for obtaining voter registration and public benefits. Texas shall require all employers to 
screen new hires through the free E-Verify system to prevent the hiring of illegal aliens and of anyone 
not legally authorized to work in the United States, and to protect jobs for American workers. No tax 
dollars shall be provided for social or educational programs for illegal aliens. All existing laws 
providing for in-state tuition and non-emergency medical care shall be rescinded. All unverifiable 
foreign-issued identification cards shall be legally invalid in the United States. In addition, the State of 
Texas should ban the sale of land to illegal aliens and pursue litigation against developers who induce 
illegal immigration into Texas through marketing.  
233. Military Readiness: We support a military force of sufficient strength and readiness to deter any 
threat to our national sovereignty or to the safety and freedom of our citizens. We oppose gender 
theory; diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) training and re-education; other social engineering topics; 
and the permitting of transgendered persons to serve in the military – elements that are poisoning our 
nation’s military effectiveness. We oppose expanding Selective Service to include women, as well as 
the lowering of standards for combat roles.

234. Cybersecurity: As foreign and domestic threats to cybersecurity evolve, the State of Texas must 
upgrade systems and system security, including conducting regular audits to identify and address 
vulnerabilities to meet these threats and share threat intelligence data among levels of government. The 
integrity of our state and local systems and infrastructure must be maintained. 
235. Keeping America Safe: We recognize that many of the threats our nation faces are not from 
foreign nation states, but militant organizations like the Latin American-based drug cartels which 
engage in cyberattacks, drug smuggling, human trafficking, and other illegal activities that endanger 
our nation, our military, and our citizens. We support aggressive military and law enforcement actions 
to combat these organizations anywhere they pose a physical threat to American citizens. 
236. Combating Illegal Immigration: We recognize illegal immigration as the greatest threat to 
American security and sovereignty. To combat the invasion at our border, we demand that both the 
federal government and the State of Texas enforce laws to their fullest extent, implement an entry/exit 
tracking system for all visa holders and biometric tracking of all inadmissible aliens, end Catch and 
Release by requiring the federal government to keep all suspected illegal aliens in custody pending 
final determination of immigration status, and devote all available resources to deportations. 
237. Non-citizen Deportation Plank for Violent Protest or Riot: The State of Texas shall enforce strict 
deportation procedures for any non-citizen, including those on work or student visas, who are arrested 
for participating in a violent protest or riot. Upon arrest, these individuals shall be immediately 
processed for deportation to their country of origin. Those deported under this policy will be 
permanently classified as “inadmissible,” forever banning them from reentering the United States. 
Additionally, non-citizen students arrested for such activities will be expelled from their educational 
institutions without refunds and processed for deportation as described. 
238. Putting American Citizens First in Immigration Policy: Our federal immigration system should be 
reformed to serve the interest of American citizens first. Accordingly, we support the implementation of 
a merit-based system that ensures the total number of new immigrants should be limited to a level that 
facilitates assimilation. In light of the millions of illegal aliens and unlawful expansion of mass 
immigration into the United States, a net migration moratorium should be enacted. We support the 
repeal of the H1-B visa program, ending the Diversity Visa Lottery, and preventing chain migration in 
the interest of protecting American jobs, technology, and national security. We support additional court 
resources to expedite final determination of status and deportation for both violent and non-violent 
illegal aliens and visa overstays. We call on Congress to end the Refugee Resettlement program and 
enter into Third Safe Country agreements for the purpose of lowering the number of asylees coming to 
the United States from around the globe. 
Border Security and Immigration 
239. Border Security Funding: We expect both the Texas Legislature and the United States Congress to 
prioritize the allocation of funds to effectively secure the border through whatever means necessary, 
including, but not limited to barriers, a border wall, and/or fences everywhere along the border where 
they are feasible and useful, and appropriate numbers of personnel and technology over land, sea, and 
air shall be made available. Texas shall seek repayment from the Federal Government for expenses 
incurred in securing its international border. 
240. State Self-Defense: We urge the Texas Legislature to invoke Article 1, Section 10, Clause 3, of the 
United States Constitution, also known as the “state self-defense clause,” which asserts that under an 
active invasion (as defined or declared by the Governor of the State or Texas Legislature), the 
sovereign state of Texas has the authority and duty to defend Texas citizens, by any and all appropriate 
measures, against “imminent danger” without delay. Texas shall take these measures as a sovereign 
state when it determines it is necessary to defend its territory from such assaults. We call for the Texas 
Legislature to create a Border Protection Unit with the authority to repel illegal crossings and deport 
apprehended illegal aliens. We must immediately equip the Texas Military Department with the 
necessary tools and authority to serve and protect our Texas territory and citizens.  
Table of Contents 
40
241. Interstate Border Compact: We urge the Texas Legislature to establish effective interstate 
compact(s) with other states for the purpose of securing the Texas portion of the United States border 
and enforcing immigration laws.  
242. End Sanctuary Cities, Require 287(g): The Texas Legislature should prioritize legislation to 
require all law enforcement entities within the state to participate in the United States Immigration and 
Nationality Act, Section 287(g) program, which allows local law enforcement officials to cooperate 
with federal immigration agents. State and federal funds shall be denied to any public or private entity, 
including but not limited to sanctuary cities that are not compliant with immigration laws. The State of 
Texas shall prosecute the responsible elected officials of sanctuary cities, counties, or states for 
obstruction of immigration laws. 
243. Aid to Illegal Aliens: We call for prohibition of federal or state funding to any entity or 
organization that provides material aid or benefit to illegal aliens, and to revoke tax-exempt status 
and/or business licenses of any entity or organization found to have done so. 
Foreign Affairs 
244. Defeating the Globalist Agenda: We recognize that we are living in a time of geopolitical 
upheaval and unprecedented complexity of threats to our liberties, constitutional governance, and 
national sovereignty. These threats emanate from “globalist” agents both within and outside our 
borders. The United States is a sovereign nation founded on the principles of freedom. We reject any 
assertion of authority over our nation or its citizens from foreign individuals or entities, such as the 
World Economic Forum, World Health Organization, and the United Nations. We stand firmly against 
the concept of a One World Government or The Great Reset. 
245. Dependency on Foreign Nations: We call upon the United States to re-examine our trading 
relationships based on America’s economic and foreign policy interests in order to eliminate 
dependency on adversarial nations, such as China, for critical medical, technological, energy, and other 
vital resources. Critical infrastructure such as internet, cabling, electrical, power, and water facilities 
shall not be owned by companies with ownership in adversarial nations. 
246. Western Pacific: We call upon the United States to move towards diplomatic recognition of 
Taiwan as an independent nation and renew our commitment to defend our security and vital economic 
interests in the Western Pacific region in the face of China’s military provocations, which threaten its 
neighbors and critical maritime trade routes. We call upon the United States to continue an effective 
containment strategy of North Korea. We hold that Taiwan, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, the 
Philippines, and South Korea are critical economic and strategic partners with the United States. 
247. Europe: We value our historic and strategic alliance with our European partners. It is critical that 
European nations take increased responsibility for their individual and collective self-defense by 
fulfilling their financial and military obligations to the NATO Treaty, thereby ensuring the 
sustainability and effectiveness of the alliance. We call on the United States to reevaluate its role and 
participation in NATO, ensuring that our commitments are aligned with national interests and the fair 
distribution of defense responsibilities. If those countries do not promptly implement such changes, we 
call on the United States to create new alliances with like-minded, willing, and capable nations to 
replace NATO. Furthermore, we urge the United States to cease all military engagements, across all 
domains of warfare, in the Ukraine-Russia conflict and on the periphery of the Russian Federation’s 
borders, advocating instead for diplomatic solutions and national sovereignty. 
248. Middle East, North Africa, and India: We recognize the critical importance of securing vital trade 
routes, including those in the Persian Gulf and Red Sea, for maintaining global supply chains and 
ensuring global security. We commend the implementation of the Abraham Accords and advocate for 
continued normalization of relations between Israel and Arab states, which is essential for regional 
stability and peace. We also emphasize the need for successful deterrence against hostile actions by 
Iran and its proxies to prevent further escalations in the region. We oppose the relocation of Gazans to 
United States. We also acknowledge the strategic partnership with India as a key ally in the region, 
enhancing our collective security and economic interests.

249. Israel. We strongly condemn the violence, harassment and hatred directed toward Jews and Israel 
worldwide. We respect Israel’s rights of sovereignty, self-determination, and self-defense, and therefore 
we support: 
a) The relocation of the United States Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, Israel’s eternal and 
indivisible capital. 
b) Israel’s sovereignty over the Golan Heights. 
c) Israel’s right to exist, right to secure borders, and right to the land secured by practicing self-
defense from aggressive enemies. 
d) Prohibition of a Palestinian state within the historical borders of Israel, as it would jeopardize 
Israel’s security, and it would force Israel to give up land that God gave to the Jewish people, 
as referenced in Genesis. 
e) Israel’s maintaining a qualitative military edge over any and all adversaries through continued 
support militarily, financially, and technologically. 
f) Prohibition of the anti-Semitic Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement as a 
form of warfare being waged upon Israel, on all levels, including and especially on college 
campuses, at the United Nations, and by anti-Western nongovernmental organizations. 
g) Israel’s right to recover their hostages, protect their citizens, and defend their borders. 
h) Opposition to any two-state solutions (Land for Peace). 
250. Foreign Defense: We oppose any offensive foreign military action or any other involvement in a 
war that has not been declared by the United States Congress. Congress shall not abdicate war powers 
to the executive branch except when under imminent threat, and these powers are not to be used in a 
preemptive strike unless approved by Congress. The Texas National Guard should only be deployed to 
overseas combat zones under authorization of Congress through a declaration of war.  
251. United Nations: The United Nations is a detriment to the sovereignty of the United States and 
other countries. We support the immediate withdrawal from the current United Nations and the removal 
of the United Nations from United States soil. We oppose participation in any United Nations entity, 
program, or initiative that would compromise American sovereignty to an external entity. 
252. Unidentified Aerial Phenomena: We call on the United States Congress and the Executive Branch 
to uphold the principles of transparency and accountability by disclosing to the American people all 
pertinent information and knowledge held by United States government agencies and departments 
regarding the nature and origins of non-American Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP). In line with 
the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) and existing protocols within the Department of 
Defense, it is imperative that any classified information relevant to UAPs be reviewed for 
declassification and public release, ensuring full transparency on these matters. These disclosures are 
essential for public trust, national security, and the integrity of our government institutions.

Resolutions 
1. 
Resolution to Support Agenda 47 of President Trump: The Republican Party of Texas fully 
endorses President Trump’s Agenda 47 visionary positive solutions for the reconstruction of America, 
and will use these to recruit independent and traditional Democrat voters for a landslide victory in 
November 2024. 
2. 
Resolution Against the Misuse of the Legal System for Political Purposes: We believe that the 
Department of Justice, some State Attorneys General, and a few local county district attorneys have 
engaged in a coordinated attack against former President Donald John Trump and his supporters, by 
falsely and maliciously indicting Republican leaders, lawyers, and past or present elected officials. We 
further believe that these attacks against President Trump and his supporters constitute a threat to the 
continued existence of this Constitutional Federal Republic. We fully understand that similar misuse of 
the legal system for political purposes constitutes some of the methods used by dictators to establish 
one-party statist control over many nations. We reject and condemn this misuse of the legal system for 
political purposes and urge the American people to reject it by overwhelmingly supporting the election 
of Donald John Trump as the 47th President of the United States of America.  
3. 
2023 Impeachment: We believe that the impeachment of Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton was 
unprofessional, petty, and a fiscally irresponsible abuse of constitutional power, in which members of 
the Texas House of Representatives attempted to circumvent the will of the voters of the 2022 Election 
by removing a political opponent with little to no evidence of wrongdoing, based on a non-transparent 
and secretive short-term investigation and an unprecedented quick impeachment proceeding that lasted 
less than a day. We believe that Attorney General Ken Paxton did not commit any impeachable offense, 
condemn the actions of the Texas House of Representatives for the impeachment, and call for the State 
to reimburse the Attorney General for lost wages and legal fees during his temporary removal from 
office. 
4. 
Care for Women: Texas Republicans understand the lasting hurt that often results from a past 
abortion, we invite those who have past hurts from abortion to engage in loving conversations and 
healing counsel, and we invite post-abortive women into the pro-life conversation to spread awareness 
that abortion harms women. We maintain our belief in the sanctity of innocent human life, created in 
the image of God, which should be protected from fertilization until natural death. We are the party of 
LIFE. 
5. 
Border Invasion: The Republican Party of Texas calls upon Texas law enforcement, the Texas 
judiciary, and the Governor to act to protect Texans from the border invasion and imminent danger, 
enforcing SB 4 (88th Regular Session) and other such measures as the Governor or Legislature sees fit 
to protect Texas, without paying heed to any stays or opinions of the federal judiciary or other branch 
of federal government to the contrary.  
6. 
Urging Congress to Put Border Security First, Oppose Further Aid to Ukraine: The Republican 
Party of Texas calls for an immediate cessation of further taxpayer-funded financial, military, and 
humanitarian aid to Ukraine and urges Congress and the President to prioritize the allocation of 
resources towards securing the United States-Mexico border and deporting illegal aliens. 
7. 
Special Legislative Session: The Republican Party of Texas calls upon Governor Abbott to call a 
special session in June 2024 to address election integrity and other issues.  Specifically, the call should 
include the following: 
a) Legislation to implement independent, state-level prosecution of election integrity; to address 
abortion, human smuggling, sedition, and riot; and to respond to the Court of Criminal 
Appeal’s ruling in State v. Stephens. 
b) Legislation to require proof of citizenship for new voter registration and a thorough review of 
existing voter rolls to identify and remove illegal aliens, other non-citizens, those with 
unauthorized non-residential addresses, and long-time inactive voters from the voter rolls.
