Our Platform
Texas Democratic Party 2024 Platform
Passed on Consent under the Governing Documents of the 2024 Texas Democratic Convention in El Paso on June 8, 2024, with unanimous approval of one amendment in the Section Small Government & Infrastructure, Subsection Community Planning, 2nd Bullet.
“We have a vision of a Texas where opportunity knows no race, no gender, no color — a glimpse of what can happen in government if we simply open the doors and let the people in.”
Governor Ann Richards, Inaugural address, January 15, 1991
“The imperative is to find what is right and do it.”
Text of keynote address by Congresswoman Barbara Jordan at the "The Great Society: A Twenty-Year Critique" event held in Austin on April 18-19, 1985. She discusses the virtues of President Lyndon B. Johnson's vision for the American people.
“The Democratic Party is not a collection of diverse interests brought together only to win elections. We are united instead by a common heritage — by a respect for the deeds of the past and a recognition of the needs for the future.”
Text of a speech President John F. Kennedy intended for delivery at a meeting of the Texas Democratic Party’s State Democratic Executive Committee (SDEC) at the municipal auditorium in Austin on November 22, 1963. President Kennedy did not deliver the speech because of his assassination in Dallas prior to the meeting.

Beliefs Shaped by Democratic Values
Texas Democrats believe government can be as good as the people. We have faith that democracy, built on the honored values of family, privacy, freedom and fairness, can afford every Texan, without exception, the opportunity to achieve their inherent potential.
We believe democratic government exists to achieve as a community, state, and nation what we cannot achieve as individuals; it must not serve only a powerful few.
We believe every Texan has inalienable rights that a majority may not take away
…the right to vote
…the right to fair and open participation and representation in the democratic process
…the right to privacy.
We believe in freedom
…from government interference in our private lives and personal decisions
…to exercise civil and human rights
…of religion and individual conscience
…and that government may not establish or favor a religion or prohibit the free exercise of religion.
We believe in responsibility
…that religion and individual conscience can never serve to excuse hatred and discrimination
…that people are responsible for their actions
…that we, who have benefited so greatly from our state and country, have a responsibility to support and give back to our communities and public institutions
…that corporations are not people and should not be used to shield individuals from the responsibilities of their actions.
We believe in equal rights
…guaranteed in Section 3 of the Texas Bill of Rights
…and equality under the law guaranteed in Section 3a of the Texas Bill of Rights
…and that no state may deny any person equal protection of the laws or due process under the law as guaranteed in the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.
We believe in equal opportunity for all Texans
…to receive a quality public education at all levels
…to have access to affordable, quality health care
…to find a good job
…to buy or rent a good home in a safe community
…to breathe clean air and drink clean water
…to have our voices heard and not be drowned out by the power of unlimited money to influence or buy elections and legislation.
We believe a growing economy should benefit all Texans
…that the people who work in a business are as important as those who invest in it
…that every person should be paid a living wage
…that no person who works full time should be paid a wage below the poverty level
…that good business offers a fair deal for customers
…that regulation of unfair practices and rates is necessary
…that the burden of taxes should be fairly distributed
…that government policy should not favor corporations that seek offshore tax shelters, exploit workers, or pollute our environment.
We believe that our lives, homes, communities and country are made secure
…by appropriately staffed and trained law enforcement and emergency personnel
…by retirement and pension security
…by encouraging job security where it is possible and providing appropriate assistance and retraining when it is not
…by the preservation of our precious natural resources and quality of life
…by compassionate policy that offers a safety net for those most vulnerable and in need
…and that family values are promoted through policies that value all our families.
We believe in a United States
…made stronger by the men and women who put their lives on the line when it is necessary to engage our military to secure our nation,
…that holds our elected officials accountable to doing the same through honoring our “Sacred Trust” to our Veterans, Active Duty Personnel and their Family Members.
…made more secure by competent diplomatic leadership that uses the moral, ethical, economic assets of a powerful, free nation to avoid unnecessary military conflict.
We believe in a Texas
…made stronger by the contributions of our diverse population and by including all people equitably
…blessed with economic opportunities provided by agriculture, “old” and “new” energy sources, renowned medical and research institutions, small businesses, innovative entrepreneurs and high tech industries
…and we believe in an honest, ethical state government that serves the public interest, not the special interests of those who “pay to play.”
Based on our belief in a
government of the people, by the people, and for the people
,º we recommend specific policy goals, programs and actions,
to establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty for ourselves and our posterity
.ºº
º From President Abraham Lincoln’s Gettysburg Address, November 19, 1863
ºº  From the Preamble to the United States Constitution, signed September 17, 1787
Putting Beliefs and Values into Action

Prioritize support for small businesses at the local, state, and federal level; and
Protect and expand workers’ right to organize and collectively bargain for better compensation, benefits and working conditions.

All Texas workers should receive a living wage indexed to inflation, including tipped workers;
Strengthen existing protections and create meaningful consequences for employers who commit wage theft;
Require that all employment positions guarantee equal pay for equal work, safe working conditions, retirement and health benefits, paid sick leave, paid vacation leave, paid family leave, workplace accommodations for persons with disabilities, workplace accommodation for child nursing, and payment of prevailing wages for public projects;
Restore dignity and safety to the workplace by requiring Workers’ Compensation insurance for workers in Texas; and
Oppose “free trade” proposals that send American jobs out of the country and harm the environment, and support fair trade deals that protect and bring back American jobs.
Workers’ Rights
Eliminate all forms of forced or coerced labor, including human trafficking, sex and labor trafficking, and the exploitation of migrant labor;
Protect Texans with disabilities from substandard and subminimum wages and exploitation and ensure they have the right to work from home, if desired, whenever possible;
Mandate the right for employees to form or join a union in order to negotiate collectively with their employer without fear of union-busting attacks or laws such as prohibitions on payroll deduction of union dues;
Ensure our judicial system protects the civil rights of labor organizers, campaign workers, and those working to improve workers’ rights;

Democracy
The right to vote and to participate in civic affairs is fundamental to representative democracy, especially in times of crises that threaten these foundations. Elections must be made secure and free of encumbrance. Openness and accountability in affirming and addressing the issues addressed in our party platform, and high ethical standards in elected officials and government agencies are paramount to ensure a level playing field and a government responsive to the basic needs of its citizens. Texas Democrats support local sovereignty and oppose efforts by the Texas Legislature to preempt local self-governance.
The Texas Democratic Party supports policies and programs that:
Eliminate barriers to voting and encourage full participation in elections and governance;
Limit the pervasive influence of money in politics and ensure a level playing field;
Promote transparency, accountability, and ethics in public life and all levels of government; and
Respect local Democracy and the decisions communities make on behalf of their respective jurisdictions.

Support the establishment of a code of judicial ethics for the Supreme Court of the United States.
Education
A world-class education system is a moral imperative and an economic necessity. We must ensure every Texas child receives the best education in the country from pre-K through postsecondary, including the arts and career and technical programs. The inadequate investment in public education has created an unsustainable working environment for teachers and support personnel, as well as a persistent achievement gap for students of color, students with disabilities, and economically disadvantaged students. Our education system must value highly-skilled teachers and encourage critical thinking, collaboration, and creativity, without the harmful impacts of high-stakes standardized testing. We seek to instill in our students a practice of ethics and a desire to seek the truth, providing them with the tools to analyze and assess the validity and importance of the information they consume, from any media. Texas Democrats support the full, meaningful inclusion of Texas students with disabilities as a fundamental right and reject the notion that undocumented students should not participate fully in public education.
Early Childhood, Primary, and Secondary Education
The Texas Constitution guarantees the right to a suitable, free public education for all Texas children and places a duty on the Legislature to fund it adequately and equitably. Texas schools currently rank 45th in per-pupil funding; our teachers make $9,200 under the national average for teacher pay; and 70% of Texan teachers are considering leaving the classroom.  Federal funding that was intended for programs to offset COVID learning losses was instead used by Republicans to supplant state funding.
The Texas Democratic Party supports policies and programs that:
Protect and enhance Texas public education, so that our students are prepared for a diverse and changing labor market and to participate as engaged citizens;
Fund schools to reflect the actual cost of educating all students;
Protect public schools funded through local property taxes in Texas from funding losses resulting from loss of students to charter schools;
Utilize federal funds for their intended purpose of supplementing, not supplanting state funds;
Guarantee a safe and high-quality classroom learning environment;
Expand learning opportunities for each child at every level of education; and
Ensure students with disabilities receive an appropriate early childhood, primary, secondary, and postsecondary education in the most equitable environments, including access to the full range of services and supports called for in their individual education plans at all learning institutions.
Every Student Deserves a Highly Qualified Teacher
Teachers are the single most critical component to a student’s success in education. Teachers not only provide classroom instruction, they also provide emotional support, a sense of belonging, and often provide students with financial support, classroom supplies and other essentials at their own expense.
The Texas Democratic Party supports policies and programs that:
Restore, respect, and safeguard the rights and benefits of education employees;
Recognize the critical role teachers play in students’ lives by setting a starting salary for teachers sufficient to attract appropriately certified teachers and eliminate vacancies, with median salaries commensurate with the national averages, expanding collective bargaining rights and expanding one year contracts to three years, and funding out-of-pocket expenses for classroom materials;
Ensure that public school employees have attractive compensation packages that incentivize career-long public service of education professionals;
Protect the Teacher Retirement System (TRS) defined benefit pension system,  fund TRS at least at the level enacted by the 88th Texas Legislature, and authorize regular cost of living adjustments (COLA) for every retiree;
Encourage the Federal government to repeal the Government Pension Offset and Windfall Elimination Provision;
Provide TRS-Care funding that is based on an increasing, permanent funding mechanism;
Prohibit awarding taxpayer dollars to corporations to develop high-stakes tests and “Value Added Modeling” linked to teacher evaluations, and oppose test-based performance pay;
Support basing teacher evaluations on multiple measures designed by practicing educators;
Guarantee acceptance to a state college or university and a teaching job to high school students in the top 20 percent of their graduating class who commit to a teaching career upon certification;
Create an endorsement pathway for teaching readiness;
Enhance the Teach for Texas Loan Repayment Program by tying loan forgiveness to years of teaching service, opening the program to all fields of study, and allowing current teachers to go back to school to get additional certification in critical needs fields;
Restore funding for the Educational Aide Exemption to help teachers’ aides go back to school to become certified as full-time teachers to teach in a critical shortage area such as STEM, Bilingual Education, Special Education, or Career and Technical Education;
Guarantee that every class has a teacher certified to teach that subject;
Recruit and train teachers who reflect the state’s diversity;
Provide a mentor or master teacher for every novice teacher;
Respect support personnel by providing them due process employment rights and a salary schedule; and
Repeal existing legislation and reject further efforts to arm teachers.
Protect and Improve Texas Public Education
Establish a 100 percent equitable school finance system with sufficient state revenue to provide every child the opportunity to learn in an exemplary program and equitably reduce reliance on "Robin Hood" recapture;
Fund public schools based on enrollment, not attendance;
Fully reflect all student and district-level cost differences and regularly adjust the basic allotment for the impact of inflation and state mandates;
Guarantee local control, by locally elected school boards, reflective of the district’s diverse demographics, and require single-member districts for districts with 20,000 or more students;
Oppose the creation of a statewide “achievement” or “recovery” school district controlled by the Texas Education Agency that could contract with private operators to run neighborhood schools without local accountability;
Prohibit state takeovers of democratically-elected public school boards;
Prohibit discriminatory and overly-restrictive school dress codes and grooming requirements that violates students’ sincere cultural, gender, religious expression, or body type;
Fully fund all federal education mandates including the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) and the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA);
Prohibit misnamed “school choice” scams, such as the use of vouchers, including special education vouchers, virtual schools used as virtual vouchers, or voucher equivalent tax credit schemes that seek to support private and sectarian schools;
Strengthen state oversight of homeschooling;
Support a moratorium on new charter schools and on the expansion of existing charter school networks through charter expansion amendments, and conduct a comprehensive study of charter school impact on public education, including the fiscal impact on traditional school districts, the state budget, students, school employees, and taxpayers;
Insist on due diligence in the screening of charter applicants and veto applicants and expansion amendments from existing charter operators which fail to meet the needs of students;
Prohibit publicly funded charter schools from contracting with for-profit management companies;
Prohibit contracts between charter schools and related parties or affiliated organizations that result in conflicts of interest or the misuse of public funds;
Require property purchased or leased by charter schools with public funds be declared to be public property;
Require charter schools that receive public funds to have elected boards subject to all the same public notice, open meetings, and open records requirements that apply to traditional school districts;
Prohibit the creation of a statewide “achievement” or “recovery” school district controlled by the Texas Education Agency that could contract with private operators to run neighborhood schools without local accountability;
Support parental and community involvement in our neighborhood schools and encourage their expansion in partnership with community stakeholders, including parents and teachers, using the community school model in an effort to coordinate and integrate educational, developmental, family, health, and other comprehensive services through community-based organizations and public and private partnerships that provide access to such services to students, especially students at risk, in schools and in the community;
Use Community Schools as a primary option under the state “turnaround” statute for at least two years before additional sanctions are implemented by law;
Develop culturally relevant curriculum standards and textbook requirements based on peer-reviewed research and written by subject matter experts, as opposed to being based on the opinions of partisan extremists;
Strengthen Standards and Resources for Schools and Teachers
Ensure the adoption of instructional materials that preserve and teach the methods and content of professional arts, trades, science, and social studies experts without censorship or illegitimate editing;
Focus on setting curriculum standards and textbook requirements that teach ethical behavior and lead the charge in fighting for racial, social, and economic justice in our public schools;
Emphasize inclusion of the history and contributions of all demographics, especially communities of color and other historically marginalized groups, when deciding on curriculum and textbook content, including leveled reading materials to allow students to connect to the text; and
Require the State Board of Education to exercise absolute fiduciary responsibility for the Permanent School Fund and expose and prohibit conflicts of interest.
Establish a Quality Classroom Learning Environment
Extend appropriate class size limits to all grades, enforce those limits, and strive for smaller class sizes;
Return comprehensive testing to the beginning of the school year and its role as a diagnostic tool, replace high-stakes tests with multiple measures designed to diagnose student needs, improve instruction, and provide prescriptive plans and solutions for each student's needs, disability, and educational path;
Eliminate all pass/fail standardized tests as a measurement of student success and advancement or as a measure of teacher evaluation;
End inappropriate testing of students with disabilities whose individual education plans call for alternative assessments of their educational progress;
Provide free, accurate, and updated instructional materials aligned with educationally appropriate, non-ideological state curriculum standards and tests, including ethnic studies and environmental education programs;
Ensure that schools, classrooms, programs, and appropriate transportation are physically and programmatically accessible to all students;
Provide all students with disabilities inclusive and integrated academic and vocational instruction, evidence-informed supports, and full access to the general curriculum, extracurricular activities, and related services in classrooms with their non-disabled peers;

Equip classrooms with computers, high-speed internet access, and digital instructional materials; and
Adequately fund Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics (STEAM) and  Vocational programs.
Support policies that identify , define, and prohibit identity-based bullying and harassment within school environments.
Expand Opportunity for Every Child

Fully fund access to high-quality, full-day public pre-K for every child, count these students for full-day attendance and for all special allotments, and establish appropriate standards for the highest quality instruction;

We further recognize and support the essential role of Texas community colleges, which provide an affordable, high-quality education responsive to community needs for those who would be otherwise excluded.

While 5 million Texans were already uninsured and lacked access to healthcare, the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated this crisis, with millions of Texans losing their employer-provided health coverage as a result of the economic downturn. Texas must fix this. We will fight for a healthcare system based on and focused on preventive care and public policy rooted in science. The government should not come between patients and their healthcare providers, but should instead focus on ending disparities for marginalized and underserved communities, and addressing critical issues including maternal mortality, mental health and substance use disorder services, rural hospital closures, and increasing funding for medical research. We must expand Medicaid, protect Medicare benefits, and make prescription drugs affordable for all.
The Texas Democratic Party supports policies and programs that:
Expand Medicaid coverage to improve healthcare access throughout Texas;
Implement an affordable and universal “single-payer" healthcare system that would provide high-quality, privately delivered, publicly funded healthcare for all residents of Texas within three (3) years, including prescription drugs, vision, hearing, dental, and mental healthcare;

Fix The Grid
We must pass legislation that never allows for another tragedy like the one we faced during the February 2021 winter storm which left more than 700 Texans dead from complications associated with the failed power grid and ERCOT’s negligence.  Texas Democrats call for our state government to invest in fixing our grid to prevent future disasters, and to ensure the safety and protection of our residents against the failed management of our power grid by ERCOT. We must eliminate the legalization and use of energy price gouging as the supposed guarantor of “reliability” and establish penalties on the windfall gains to pay off the bonds that Republicans want to finance through the “Abbott Tax”.
The Texas Democratic Party supports policies and programs that:
Insist on a power grid that won’t cause a statewide disaster every time we need to crank the heat or turn up the AC by linking to the national grids for emergency power needs;
Prioritize the growth of renewable energy options;
Assure that the Public Utility Commission truly represents the public, not just utilities, as they undergo the sunset process;
Focus on the power sector instead of punishing the people, by forcing tough penalties if companies fail to comply;
Require the Public Utility Commission (PUC) and ERCOT create and enforce specific weatherization standards for all power plants including stringent standards for black start units. Black start units must be incentivized to always be ready, and penalties must be imposed when they fail;

Oppose planned bailouts for utility companies and ERCOT financed through consumer surcharges and use windfall penalties on price gougers to retire the Republican-issued bonds;
Ensure that the PUC and the Texas Railroad Commission upgrade weatherization requirements for transmission, natural gas supply chains and power plants, and further ensure that they are followed with penalties for failing to complete weatherization by the required dates;
Prioritize expanding the state’s transmission infrastructure to connect new generation to the grid;
Focus also on the demand side of energy by requiring utilities to invest in energy efficiency and demand response programs;
Pass legislation to update Texas’s outdated building codes so that buildings are more energy efficient;
Allow distributed energy resources like solar and storage to fully compete in ERCOT’s energy markets to create a modern grid;
Offer relief funding to Texas residents to help cover the costs of damaged homes, cars, other property and potentially high utility bills from price surges during extreme weather conditions, and to invest in energy efficiency measures; and
Create a new agency - Texas Energy Agency - that folds in PUC, ERCOT, RRC, and others with the mandate of planning and managing energy needs and ensuring supply now and into the future, with attention to climate change mitigation and next-generation resources.
Improving Public Safety
Reducing Gun Violence
The Texas Democratic Party supports the right of law-abiding Americans to own and bear arms as preserved in the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. We believe that the best way to uphold Texas’ strong heritage of responsible gun ownership for self defense, hunting, and recreation is to implement common sense gun safety measures that keep firearms out of the hands of criminals and others deemed dangerous to themselves and others. We call on state leaders to preserve Second Amendment rights while implementing prudent safeguards against needless suicides, senseless mass murders, tragic accidents, and interpersonal violence.
The Texas Democratic Party supports policies and programs that:

Enforce the Texas Constitution's mandate that 'No person shall ever be imprisoned for debt' and work towards dismantling modern-day debtors' prisons.

Disability Justice
Every Texan has a right to lead a productive life, enjoy liberty, and to pursue happiness. Texas Democrats will work to ensure all Texans, including Texans with disabilities, are able to exercise their right to live independently in the community in the most integrated setting of their choice. Disability rights are human rights and no person should face discrimination because they have a disability, whether or not it is visible. We will work to preserve, strengthen, and enforce all state and federal disability rights laws. Building from the landmark Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), we will work to codify the
Olmstead v. United States
decision (the U.S. Supreme Court ruling based on the ADA, affirming that people with disabilities have a qualified right to receive state-funded support and services within their community). Due to lack of enforcement, rights of people with disabilities are being violated, restricted, or denied. In addition, Texans with disabilities are often excluded in the decisions that affect them. Texans with disabilities must be integral in crafting policy pertaining to disability issues.
The Texas Democratic Party will fight for policies and programs that:
Guarantee the rights of people with disabilities, and ensure that people with disabilities can live productive, safe, and happy lives in the community;
Ensure that people have the right to recognition everywhere before the law and are therefore entitled to equal rights and treatment and that no one should be denied these basic rights because of race, color, creed, class, national origin, sex, age, religion, ethnic identity, ethnicity, language, culture, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, economic status or disability as defined by the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990;
Protect persons with disabilities, as persons under the law, from discrimination, abuse, neglect, exploitation, abandonment, endangerment, loss of liberty, and loss of life by local and state government entities;
End the idea that the State of Texas has sovereign immunity from the ADA and other federal provisions;
Ensure all government venues, including the Texas Capitol and courthouses, are physically and digitally accessible; and
Enforce the Americans with Disabilities Act requirements for public and private organizations.
Impacts of COVID-19 on People with Disabilities
Provide personal protective equipment (PPE) to clients with disabilities as well as the attendants, medical professionals, and frontline workers who interact with them;
Provide support for the transition of persons with disabilities from institutional care to community-based care providers;
Provide on-site oversight of places where people with disabilities are living in institutionalized conditions, particularly in situations where family and community members cannot visit to monitor;
Ensure merchants allow people with disabilities to use their specially designed equipment to transport groceries;
Expand home delivery to make it accessible and available to everyone;
Ensure medical system and non-emergency needs are not overloaded and that adequate disability services are provided;
End hoarding and price-gouging on delivery services and shopping services, which disproportionately impacts people with disabilities; and
Ensure people with disabilities who contract COVID-19 are entitled to the same level of care as other patients.
Religious Freedom
Religious freedom and freedom from religious establishment are fundamental rights for all Americans as manifested in both the Texas and U.S. Constitutions. We recognize the importance of religion and prayer in the lives of many Texans, that many Texans have secular beliefs, and that many Texans have non-religious philosophical beliefs. We support our Constitution’s guarantee of every individual's right to practice their own beliefs without imposing them on others.
The Texas Democratic Party supports policies and programs that:
Safeguard the free exercise of religion and prohibit government establishment of religion, of one religion or denomination over others, religion over nonreligion, or nonreligion over religion — in other words, we encourage and promote secularism, which is the separation of church and state, in government;
Guarantee individual rights, fair treatment, and protections to all minorities, including religious, non-religious, sectarian, and secular minorities; and
Ensure no religious test shall be required as a qualification for public office.
As the U.S. Constitution prohibits the establishment of a favored religion and any religious test for public office, while guaranteeing free religious exercise, we believe:
That, just as personal faith and values guide and inspire us to further the well-being of our community, we must never use the power of government at any level to promote one religion or denomination over others or to impose our personal religious observances;
That the determination of when life begins is a religious doctrinal issue that is viewed differently by different religions and denominations, and while the right to hold differing views should be respected, imposing the doctrine of some religious denominations on others violates the First Amendment;
Government must not inhibit the free exercise of religion, but religion can never be used as an excuse to discriminate against or harm others;
In the separation of church and state;
Our founders wisely provided for the separation of church and state, which allows religion to flourish in freedom, and respects those who have no religious faith;
Government must not use any public funds to support religious positions, activities, or private schools, as expressed in both the U.S. and Texas Constitutions;
Entangling government with religion is dangerous to both government and religion; and
That the religious test for public office in the Texas Constitution is a violation of the U.S. Constitution and must be removed.
Religion should not be invoked to supersede the rights of others. These rights include:
Legal protection from discrimination, including for LGBTQIA+ Texans;
Nondiscrimination for individuals in service or public accommodations in the private sector;
Fair treatment and non-exploitation in employment and business;
The protection of children and the needy;
Access to healthcare for all, particularly for women and families;
Family planning services and access to abortion;
Nondiscrimination in the provision of goods and services by government, directly or through grants and contracts;
The disseminating of valid voter protection information by trusted sources like faith communities;
Life and health, which are prioritized by all religions, must not be jeopardized by requiring voters to only vote in-person instead of by mail during a pandemic; and
Free speech and freedom of expression, including the right of individual persons to address grievances through boycotts.
Equity & Social Justice
The diversity of Texas is a source of our strength and all our people are equally deserving of dignity, respect, inclusion and equitable treatment. Texas Democrats oppose and will work to eliminate the systemic disparities. The opposite of diversity is “Likeness”, the opposite of equity is “Inequity”, the opposite of inclusion is “Exclusion” - “L.I.E.s”. Democrats support programs that recognize the benefits of our diversity and promote equity and inclusion. We will fight the Republican actions that promote and favor L.I.E.s. We unite together and amplify each other’s voices for a more equitable, inclusive, just, and free Texas.
The Texas Democratic Party supports policies and programs that:
Allow all people to live to their fullest potential;
Promote equity and ensure that Texans of all backgrounds are treated with dignity and respect;
Ensure that people are entitled to equal rights and treatment, and that no one should be denied these basic rights because of race, color, creed, class, national origin, sex, age, religion, ethnic identity, ethnicity, language, culture, sexual orientation, sexual traits/characteristics, gender, gender identity, gender expression, economic status, disability, tribal affiliation, immigration status, and/or justice involvement;
Value and assure women’s full, equal, and essential role in Texas’ future success;
Ensure equal protections and rights for all lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, intersex, asexual, and other non-cis non-heterosexual or LGBTQIA+ people;
Require the inclusion of fact-based, fair perspectives from all marginalized groups in history and social studies classes in Texas public education;

Rectify proactively the contemporary effects of discrimination against Asian Americans, especially those effects stemming from COVID-19-related xenophobia;
Appreciate and teach Asian American contributions to American society such as knitting the country together with the transcontinental railroad and pioneering Universal Basic Income;

African American Texans
Acknowledge African Americans as the descendants of the survivors of the middle passage, chattel slavery, convict leasing, and mass incarceration, an ongoing condition that remains unresolved;
Provide reparations for the descendants of slaves who were brought to America through the Atlantic slave trade;
Treat today’s thriving Black families as the experts; those who mastered the Black experience of survival and resiliency under the weight of prolonged systemic oppression;
Uphold that African Americans are not a monolith and own the right to address their issues individually or collectively, as a distinct cultural group, without suspicion or fear of unjustified retribution for doing so as exemplified by the Red Summer of 1919 or the FBI’s COINTELPRO and IRON FIST programs;
Affirm African Americans’ right to explore new solutions, while recommitting to those practical approaches that made the triumphs of their 400-year survival possible; and
Make better health outcomes possible in the African American community by effectively addressing the Five Social Determinants of Health: economic stability, education, social and community context, health and healthcare access, and the built environment in and around communities where they live, work, and play.
Hispanic/Latina/e/o Texans
Affirm the dignity and the civil and human rights of all documented and undocumented persons and stand against racism, religious discrimination, and persecution; and
Hold the government accountable to all individuals and communities it serves, documented and undocumented, and ensure it is not used as a tool for oppression or intimidation.
Make better health outcomes possible in the Latin community by effectively addressing the Five Social Determinants of Health: economic stability, education, social and community context, health and healthcare access, and the built environment in and around communities where they live, work, and play.
Support strong job safety and wage theft policies, which overwhelmingly and disproportionately impact Latino and undocumented communities due to language barriers, exploitation of legal status, and discrimination.
Uphold that Latines are not a monolith and own the right to address their issues individually or collectively, as a cultural group made up of distinct nationalities and cultural backgrounds.
Indigenous Texans
Acknowledge that our institutions were built on land stolen from a variety of Aztlan Nation and American Indian groups, including the Caddo, Apache, Karankawa, Comanche, Wichita, Coahuiltecan, Tonkawa, and many more;
Condemn past and present wrongs against Aztlan Nation and American Indians including the genocide, erasure, and exclusion of Indigenous Texans;
Support tribal sovereignty, including the rights of tribal communities to maintain jurisdiction over crimes committed by non-Native people against Native people on tribal land, administer elections on tribal land, and regulate environmental protections on tribal land;
that the indigenous people of Texas have rights and deserve forms of reparations, and that tribal lands should be returned when at all possible;

Commit to building relationships with American Indians and tribal communities as well as to decolonizing ourselves and our institutions.

Since the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) has been passed by a two-thirds vote of Congress and by three-fourths of state legislatures, the ERA has met all the requisites of Article V and should be enrolled by the Archivist of the United States as an amendment to the U.S. Constitution;

Family and Individual Security
All people have a right to live in safe, secure, and healthy environments, and that no one in Texas should live without a home, electricity, or running water that is provided by a secure power grid that functions in all weather. Texas Democrats imagine a world in which compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act is a given, not a fight, and all people can comfortably retire with dignity and financial security.
The Texas Democratic Party supports policies and programs that:
Ensure people with disabilities and older adults can live safely and independently in the community supported by appropriate personal care;
Preserve and protect retirement benefits, including Social Security, private and public pensions; and
Provide housing, utilities, and insurance options to all at affordable prices supplemented by public and private assistance as needed.

Immigration
Texas Democrats call for an immigration system that serves our families, communities, and economies. Border communities managing immigration on the frontlines face special challenges and bring local knowledge that requires respect from state-level policymakers. We should ensure that state funding is provided to impacted communities and support the services they need, rather than waste money on misleading political publicity stunts. Importantly, viewing immigrants through the lens of fear and prejudice only serves to undermine our values, prosperity, and security as a state and as a nation. Our government’s failure to enact meaningful, long-term immigration reform has left us with the broken system we have today. Our country is stronger with a more fair and equitable immigration system.
The United States has always been a vibrant nation of immigrants. We value those who come from different countries and cultures. Immigrants add to the prosperity, innovation, and resilience of this great country. Immigrants hold professional jobs, teach in our educational institutions, own businesses, build our homes, grow our food, and contribute hundreds of billions of dollars to the Texas economy. Texas Democrats will work to foster better bilateral relationships with all nations including our southern neighbor with whom we share an expansive border.
The Texas Democratic Party supports policies and programs that:
Enact comprehensive immigration reform, including an attainable path to citizenship;
Reform employment and education-based immigration, including an increase in visas, to continue to attract and retain innovative and talented individuals from across the world;

Demilitarize and scale back policing saturation of border communities, particularly halting the fiscally wasteful Operation Lone Star; and
Support better foreign aid, policies toward more regionally-based supply chains, and other economic development in the Americas, home to over 1 billion people in the world, in order to expand economic opportunities in the Americas and reduce the need of migrants to leave their home countries and migrate to our southern border.
Rural Texas & Agriculture
Our rural communities, along with the farmers, ranchers, small business owners, and others who live in them, deserve a bold political agenda to restore economic prosperity to the small towns and rural areas of our country. We support rural values of self-reliance and devotion to our country, the preservation of private property rights and separation of church and state, and initiatives to revitalize rural America, including farm policies that restore fair prices and address the current credit crisis confronting American agriculture.
The Texas Democratic Party supports policies and programs that:
Provide grants and loans to lift the rural economy out of the crisis created by globalization and technology;

Promote responsible agriculture, including trade policies to encourage open global markets and fair competition coupled with domestic price supports to enable producers to orderly market their products and receive fair prices that cover costs of production plus a reasonable profit;
Prohibit discrimination against family farmers in being denied access to loans or assistance simply because they exercise the right to use federal bankruptcy laws to restructure finances; and
Ensure the protection of migrant farmworkers, who play a crucial role in the Texas agricultural economy, from inhumane working conditions and provide just wages and humane living conditions.

Accessible and Affordable Healthcare for Rural Texans
Accept Medicaid expansion in Texas and recognize that healthcare is a fundamental right which should be affordable and accessible to all;
Address the scarcity of healthcare resources by providing public grants to incentivize health workers to locate in rural towns and open facilities designed to provide the services needed in rural areas;
Use technological advances, such as telehealth, to provide access to consultative care in rural areas; offer comparatively reimbursed telehealth to increase access to health and behavioral health care in rural areas; and

Smart Government & Infrastructure
A fair and transparent government should serve all people. Smart government means investing for our future, ensuring the health of our residents, and facilitating an economy that benefits all Texans. We reinforce the right of all people to freedom of travel and recreate through safe, easily accessible roadways, walkways, bikeways, pathways and transit routes. We support capital and government investment in infrastructure such as roads, bridges, utilities, internet services, water supply and flood control, schools, ports, parks, and public buildings. We must properly fund education and make it available to all. We believe that all working Texans should be able to afford a decent, accommodating home within a reasonably commutable distance from their workplace. We also value the diversity of our communities and believe that the State of Texas should recognize the governing authority of those communities on issues where local authority best serves the health and safety of the community.

Veterans Issues
Service Members and Veterans should be honored for their service and deserve the benefits they have earned and been promised.

We urge the full and adequate funding of the Texas Veterans Commission, its “Strike Force Teams” and our extension of State County Veterans Service Offices in order to better  support our mutual mission of providing superior service to Veterans.

Consumer Protection
Our government has a duty to protect Texans from predatory lending, dangerous products, price gouging during natural disasters and other fraudulent, unfair or discriminatory business practices. We aim to make consumer financial markets work for consumers, responsible product/service providers, and the economy as a whole. In a market economy that works optimally, the prices, risks, and terms of the deal are clear upfront so that consumers can understand their options and comparison shop. Companies should all play by the same consumer protection rules, compete fairly on providing quality and service, and be able to rely on the consistent fairness of a level playing field and structure their business practices accordingly to maximize benefit.

Foreign Policy
Texas Democrats believe peace, prosperity, and national security are best achieved by maintaining a strong national defense, promoting democracy, advancing development abroad, and supporting and engaging with the United Nations and its institutions. Our policies should prioritize prevention and diplomacy through our State Department, with military action used only as a last resort and authorized only as allowed by our Constitution. Texas Democrats support consistent diplomacy and development efforts abroad in coordination with our allies who promote freedom and justice, and strongly oppose actions that drive out skilled diplomats and replace them with partisan, ideologically-driven political appointees.
The Texas Democratic Party supports policies and programs that:
