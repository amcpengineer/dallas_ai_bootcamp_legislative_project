Gina was elected President of the Austin ISD Board by her Board colleagues. During her leadership, AISD increased teacher pay, balanced the budget, and for the first time ever, every high school in AISD met the state’s accountability standards AND NO SCHOOL WAS CLOSED.Gina ran for the Texas House in 2016 motivated by a determination to redirect more of our local property taxes to our neighborhood public schools.

Representative Perez found that a small number of private attorneys were being over-appointed to hundreds of criminal defense cases. As a result, the county was providing in inadequate defense for defendants, excessively incarcerate low-level defendants not yet found guilty, and creating extensive backlogs in criminal court dockets.The Texas Indigent Defense Commission (TIDC), the state agency that oversees indigent defense throughout all 254 Texas Counties concurred with Representative Perez’s findings and compelled the judiciary to devise and implement a plan to change its practices.That same year, he successfully proposed the creation of the County’s first pretrial office to promptly assess a defendant’s safety risk to the community, their mental health background, and their need for public defense. He also successfully expanded the operations of the county jail magistrate to 24-hours a day, 7-days a week to ensure defendants could promptly appear before a judge and processed without delay.Under his leadership, El Paso County also became one of the first counties in the nation to implement the “CourTools model” by the National Center for State Courts to provide judges and the general public information about the efficiency and cost of court operations.While other counties such as Harris, Dallas, and Galveston were the subject of multimillion dollar lawsuits for their criminal justice practices, El Paso County was spared from such litigation, and is now a national leader in best practices for criminal justice.In 2016, Representative Perez was named the ""National County Leader of the Year"" by American City & County Magazine for his leadership in county governance and county-level criminal justice reforms. He was the first County Commissioner in Texas to earn this recognition.In 2018, Representative Perez successfully proposed the creation of the County Economic Impact Fund to promote economic development in the Borderplex region.

82,Tom Craddick,,,,,,"When Tom Craddick was 25 years old, he decided to seek office in the Texas House of Representatives as a (party) from his hometown of Midland. At the time, Texas was a one-party state, and many thought him foolhardy. His father, R. F. Craddick, warned the young Ph.D. student at Texas Tech University against it. ""Texas is run by Democrats,"" he told him. ""You can´t win."" But Craddick proved his father and many others wrong, and was elected as one of only nine (party) in the 150-seat House.His tenure has been characterized by landmark events. His initial years at the Capitol were focused on revitalizing the Texas GOP, but in 1971 he gained respect from both sides when he joined a bipartisan group of reformists dubbed ""The Dirty 30"" that was pushing for changes in House Ethics. In 1975, Speaker Bill Clayton appointed Craddick as the first (party) committee chairman in 100 years, and he continued to hold chairmanships under Clayton´s successors, Gib Lewis and Pete Laney.On January 11, 2003 he made state history when, subsequent to his 34-year tenure in the Texas House of Representatives, he became the first (party) Speaker—after helping gain the (party) Majority in the House-for the first time in more than 130 years.Craddick served as speaker from January 2003 - January 2009. During that time, Texas went from a $10 billion budget shortfall to a $10 billion budget surplus. The legislature passed landmark tort reform which reduced frivolous lawsuits and reversed skyrocketing medical liability insurance costs, resulting in more doctors moving to Texas and expanding access to care. The legislature also passed the largest property tax cut in Texas history under Craddick´s watch, and reformed a school finance system that had been ruled unconstitutional by the Texas Supreme Court.As Speaker, Craddick demonstrated an appreciation for diversity and bipartisanship by appointing a record number of women and minorities -- including 12 Democrats -- as chairmen.Craddick is also a successful businessman. He owns Craddick Properties, a Midland investment business, and is president of Craddick, Inc.Craddick holds both a Bachelor of Business Administration and a Master of Business Administration from Texas Tech University. Craddick married the former Nadine Nayfa, a native of Sweetwater, in 1969. They have two children, Christi and Thomas Russell, Jr. Their son, Tommy, married the former Laura Parker in 2004.

Martinez Fischer previously chaired the House Democratic Caucus, and served as Chair of the Mexican American Legislative Caucus (MALC) from 2009-2016. Rep.

Texas Monthly perhaps put it best when, in naming Rep. Martinez Fischer one of the 10 Best Legislators in the state in 2013, they declared him “a soldier prepared to do battle but ready to make peace.” Though often outnumbered by his opponents, Rep. Martinez Fischer has repeatedly delivered legislative victories for the people of San Antonio, defeating harmful legislation and working to pass job-creating, bipartisan legislation of his own.Among his most important accomplishments was leading budget negotiations to restore $3.93 billion dollars in public education funding cuts in 2013, despite being outnumbered by the legislative majority in the House. Rep. Martinez Fischer’s relentless pursuit on behalf of Texas school children and educators earned him the prestigious “Friend of Education Award” as well as a “Legislative Star” recognition by the Texas Classroom Teachers Association.Another of Rep.

Rep. Martinez Fischer is one of the best state lawmakers according to Texas Monthly, who named him one of the “10 Best” lawmakers in both the House and Senate three sessions in a row (2011, 2013, 2015). In 2015, the publication also awarded him the ‘Bull of the Brazos Award’ for being the most effective advocate in the legislature.Other legislative victories abound: when school supplies were excluded from being eligible for tax-free weekend, Rep. Martinez Fischer passed a middle-class tie-in that included school supplies in the sales tax exemption and made it easier for parents to buy books, backpacks, and pencils for their kids. In 2019, Rep. Martinez Fischer played a leading role in passing Senate Bill 1264, the strictest protections against surprise medical billing in the country. His bipartisan work on this proposal served as the model for the United States Congress when they passed a similar measure. In 2009, Rep.

Martinez Fischer is a practicing lawyer in the San Antonio area. He has practiced in front of numerous state and federal courts throughout Texas since his admission to the bar. Rep.

Representative Walle has authored a variety of bills toward those priorities, including providing water utility customers recourse for nonexistent water service, helping nursing mothers return to work, establishing Texas’ Maternal Mortality and Morbidity Task Force, and the Institute for a Disaster Resilient Texas. His efforts as an elected official have been instrumental in bringing new clinics to medically underserved areas in House District 140, and building the East Aldine Town Center-- which includes the BakerRipley campus, the Harris County 911 Call Center, and a Lone Star College-North Harris campus.Most recently, he brought home wins for HD 140 by securing funding for an $18 million flood control project, supporting the construction of a new food bank/community center and joint-authoring legislation to establish a $3 billion endowment for certain Texas universities — including the University of Houston. In previous Sessions, Armando established the Maternal Mortality and Morbidity Task Force, the Institute for a Disaster Resilient Texas, and was instrumental in the construction of the East Aldine Town Center.Representative Walle is currently a member of the House Committee on Appropriations, serving as Chair of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Articles VI, VII, VII (natural resources, business & industry, and regulatory entities). Representative Walle, in his work on the House Appropriations committee, has sought to broaden access to healthcare by providing more resources to and protecting the state's women’s health programs while fighting perennial efforts to erode safety net programs crucial to so many children and families across the state. In his service on the Article VI, VII, VIII subcommittee, he has worked to bolster our state's water supply while also increasing our flood readiness statewide. He also serves as a member of the House Committee on Licensing and Administrative Procedures, the Select Committee on Sustainable Property Tax Relief, the Select Committee on Health Care Reform and the House Committee on House Administration.Representative Walle has previously also served on the House Committees on Energy Resources, Human Services, Business & Industry, Insurance, Higher Education, Redistricting, as well as the Appropriations Subcommittees on Article II (health and human services agencies) and Article III (public and higher education), and others.Representative Walle is a member of a number of legislative caucuses, including the Mexican-American Legislative Caucus, for which he serves on the board as General Counsel. He is also the chairman of the Legislative Study Group  – an official caucus that analyzes every bill that comes to the House Floor. He is also a member of the House Democratic Caucus, Women’s Health Caucus, and LGBTQ Caucus.Before Representative Walle was elected to the Texas House, he served on the staff of multiple elected officials, including Congressman Gene Green and Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee, where he led different community projects including Immunization Day, Paying for College workshops and senior citizen issue forums. Now a practicing attorney, Representative Walle earned his bachelor's and law degree from the University of Houston.In his free time, State Representative Walle enjoys spending time with his family-- his wife, Debbie Walle, a Texas Women's University graduate, and their two young sons-- frequently celebrating and lamenting the ups and downs of his beloved University of Houston Cougars, Houston Astros, Houston Texans, and Houston Rockets.",https://house.texas.gov/members/member-page/?district=140,https://house.texas.gov/members/4930/biography,https://house.texas.gov/images/members/4930.jpg?v=1,https://capitol.texas.gov/reports/report.aspx?ID=author&LegSess=89R&Code=A4930,https://capitol.texas.gov/reports/report.aspx?ID=coauthor&LegSess=89R&Code=A4930,https://capitol.texas.gov/reports/report.aspx?ID=sponsor&LegSess=89R&Code=A4930,https://capitol.texas.gov/reports/report.aspx?ID=cosponsor&LegSess=89R&Code=A4930

Jolanda was initiated into Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Incorporated, at the University of Houston’s Epsilon Lambda, in the Fall of 1987. She is a current dues-paying member of Mu Kappa Omega!Her single mom raised Jolanda after her dad committed suicide in her presence. She was confronted with multiple evictions, houses burning down, bullying, rape, domestic violence, being shot at, seeing dead bodies, lack of food, gas, water, and electricity, and being bullied. She overcame the murder of her brother, aunt, and numerous cousins, the SIDS death of her niece, and survived death threats related to her legal practice.Jolanda has distinguished herself legally, garnering prestigious legal awards. Her courtroom expertise helped shut down Houston Police Department’s Crime Lab that faked lab results that convicted innocents and allowed the guilty to go free. She defeated a powerful politician by reuniting an African mom with her child whom that politician had stolen. Her legal acumen has won multiple murder cases and serious felonies. Her business is 24 years old.She has been the moral conscience and the voice of the disadvantaged and disenfranchised in every elected body she has served. She is a go-to person who fights for and stands up to those who seek to oppress. She grew up in a union household and believes in the invaluable power of unions.Jolanda has and continues to improve the lives of her constituents and helps create jobs and opportunities for small and minority businesses.

One: a gunshot victim. Two: an SUV rollover victim who was ejected on the freeway. Three: a hit-and-run victim. Four: a victim passed out on a busy street. And her fifth and most notable save, for which she won a HERO Award, was that of a teenager whose car fell approximately 100 feet off of a freeway interchange, caught fire, and exploded seconds after Jolanda and her son extricated her. Jolanda ran to safety 50 meters with the teenager in her arms.If someone is in danger and Jolanda is near, she will be the person who rushes in to save whoever needs saving. Jolanda feels compelled to save people due to the many times she was a victim of circumstance and in need of help, combined with her mother’s teachings that she must have the courage to do what is right when it’s easier to do wrong and that she must help people who, but for her help, would be helpless.Jolanda is a TV personality on CBS’s Survivor Pa- Lau and was the star of WEtv’s Sisters in Law.
