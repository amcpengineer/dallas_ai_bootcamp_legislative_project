He previously served 10 years, from 1998 - 2008, as the Harris County Tax Assessor-Collector, where he introduced “Smart Government” at the Harris County Tax Office and developed a customer service-driven organization. His team created the first major county online property tax payment system and the first county tax office website with online vehicle registration in Texas. (His motto was “Get on-line, not in-line.”) He was well-known as the “Tax Man” for his outspoken efforts to cut property taxes. In the most recent Legislative Session, Senator Bettencourt successfully passed Senate Bill 2, the Texas Property Tax Reform and Transparency Act of 2019, by a vote of 21-9 to bring meaningful property tax reform and relief to all Texas taxpayers. This was the first major property tax reform legislation in almost 40 years, and the culmination of two decades of advocacy.

A compassionate conservative, Senator Bettencourt has been a leader on ""Right to Try"" and adult stem cell legislation, fighting for terminally and chronically ill patients across Texas to have better access to treatments and new therapies. Legislation that he sponsored on this important issue was adopted by the American Legislative Exchange Council as a national model other states could follow. He has also greatly expanded dual credit opportunities (SB 1004) for Texas students and Joint-Authored bipartisan legislation to enhance educational opportunities for students through ISD/Charter partnerships (SB 1882). Numerous organizations have acknowledged Senator Bettencourt for his work in the Texas Senate. In his first session, Capitol Inside named him ""Most Valuable Freshman"" and Vision America named him their ""Outstanding Texas Legislator.""

Senator Eckhardt has deep roots in Central Texas and deep commitment to improving opportunity for all Texans. After receiving an LBJ School Master of Public Affairs and law degree from the University of Texas at Austin in 1998, Eckhardt worked for eight years as an Assistant Travis County Attorney. From 2006-2013 she served as Travis County Commissioner representing 300,000 people. From 2015-2020 she served as the Travis County Judge presiding over the Commissioners Court and representing 1.3 million people. Senator Eckhardt believes that elective office is a temporary trust bestowed by the people who elect her. She values policy above politics. And she believes that government exists to assure that opportunity is within reach of every Texan. Government should be effective, efficient, fair and minimally intrusive. Eckhardt's public service experience includes emergency response, health care, workforce and economic development, criminal justice, water policy, transportation, and budget and finance. Some of her previous accomplishments include curtailing the spread of COVID-19 in Central Texas through early and decisive region-wide orders, preserving more than 30,000 acres of green space, building a multi-county collaboration for the preservation of groundwater, maintaining a vibrant construction economy while raising safety standards for workers, establishing a Travis County Public Defender's Office, and instituting jail and arrest diversion programs that support justice and public safety. Senator Eckhardt learned public service from her mother and father and is inspired to continue serving by her son and daughter. Her mother Nadine Eckhardt and her father Congressman Bob Eckhardt served Texas and especially the most vulnerable Texans in the halls of the State Capitol and the US Capitol. Her children Nadine and Hank inspire her daily to make Texas a better place for generations to come.","The Honorable Sarah Eckhardt, P.O.

First elected in 2018 with bipartisan support, he has become a leading voice in healthcare, the electrical grid, government transparency, criminal justice, and state infrastructure. Johnson knows that policymakers must meet the changing demands of Texas’s rapid growth and profound economic, social, and technological advances. This means developing new infrastructure – both physical (e.g., the electrical grid) and social (e.g., health), and making government more responsive and effective. And so Johnson has played a central role in strengthening the Texas grid; his work in healthcare resulted in hundreds of thousands of newly insured Texans; his work on economic policy promoted opportunity in overlooked regions and made it more difficult to abuse tax incentives; and he has made state agencies more accountable while helping them better meet the needs of the public. Johnson holds a B.S. in physics and a J.D. in law. He practices law at Thompson Coburn LLP, where he specializes in trial litigation and dispute resolution.

Col. (Ret.) Brian Birdwell is a native Texan, decorated military veteran and lifelong conservative Republican proudly representing Texas Senate District 22. Born in Fort Worth, Brian is a graduate of Lamar University in Beaumont, U.S. Army Command and General Staff College, and the University of Missouri-Kansas City, where he earned a Master of Public Administration degree. As the Distinguished Military Graduate of the Lamar Army ROTC program in 1984, Brian was commissioned as an officer in the U.S. Army and served a 20-year career with numerous training deployments and two operational deployments. In 1990, he deployed to Operation Desert Shield/Desert Storm, where he was awarded the Bronze Star for Exceptional Meritorious Achievement. In 1998, he deployed to Central America as the Joint Operations Officer for Joint Task Force Aguila to execute humanitarian relief operations in the aftermath of Hurricane Mitch. In 2001, Brian was serving on the Department of the Army staff at the Pentagon as the military aide to the Deputy Assistant Chief of Staff for Installation Management. On September 11, 2001, when American Airlines Flight 77 was crashed just yards away from his second floor Pentagon office, Brian was critically wounded and severely burned. Of the burns that covered more than 60 percent of his body, nearly half were third degree in severity. Today, following 39 operations, months of hospitalization and numerous skin grafts, Brian has made a miraculous recovery. Despite physical limitations, he testifies not only to his physical healing, but the ultimate miracle of grace through Christ. He was awarded the Purple Heart for wounds received that day. Upon retirement in July 2004, he was awarded the Legion of Merit. From 2004 to 2017, Brian and his wife, Mel, operated Face the Fire Ministries, a non-profit organization they jointly founded to support critical-burn survivors and wounded service-members and their families. In 2004, the Birdwells jointly authored Refined by Fire: A Family's Triumph of Love and Faith , which chronicles their life-changing ordeal.

Brian is proud of his diverse and impactful legislative accomplishments, including filing and passing legislation broadening access to higher education, strengthening eminent domain laws protecting landowners, expanding self-defense rights of law-abiding gun owners, strengthening legislative oversight of state river authorities, increasing technical- and associate-degree options for high school graduates and adult students, serving Texas veterans and their family members, and authoring the strongest border security package in Texas history—the Stronger Border, Safer Texas Act. In 2017, Brian led the successful effort to make Texas just the eleventh state in the nation to pass a resolution and corresponding legislation calling for an Article V convention of states. Brian chaired the Sunset Commission for the 2018 interim and 2019 Regular Session, which made numerous improvements to state agencies. One of the most critical reforms which Brian carried was the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission bill, which reformed several antiquated provisions of the Alcoholic Beverage Code, among other significant changes as well as other agencies. Brian serves as Chairman of the Senate Committee on Natural Resources, which is responsible for legislation relevant to our oil and gas industry, air quality, waste, and environmental permitting and quality at the state and local level.
